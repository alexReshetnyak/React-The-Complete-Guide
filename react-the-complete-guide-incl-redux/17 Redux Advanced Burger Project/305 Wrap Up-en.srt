1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,040
We added a lot of logic in this module,

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:12,120
we now really have advanced redux usage with refactored reducers with lean switch case statements,

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:20,730
we're handling async code with action creators. We're applying middleware in our index.js file to have

4
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,230
redux-thunk being added to be able to have async action creators.

5
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,440
We're doing a lot of stuff with redux and we still and that's always important,

6
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,140
do not everything with it because we don't have to manage everything with redux as I showed you.

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,430
It's fine to still manage some state like a modal if it should be shown or not through the local UI

8
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,670
state.

9
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,810
I like how our application's work and behaving,

10
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,820
the next step is to add authentication to it.

11
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,470
Since this is another core feature a lot of apps use

12
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,990
and I want to show you how to add it the react way.

13
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,080
So let's do that.
