1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:07,700
In the last lecture, we were able to implement that we are redirected, now however we can see that

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:13,610
our price never is reset once we are redirected, so once we are done, we had that issue before already.

3
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:20,930
Now the price never resets because in our burger builder reducer where we manage the total price,

4
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:28,790
we only update the price when we add or remove ingredients but we never reset it when we call setIngredients,

5
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,440
the setIngredient action is dispatched whenever this page is loaded

6
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:40,610
though, we do it in the burger builder componentDidMount hook and that is on purpose, I want to load

7
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,260
my ingredients and reset them whenever this component gets mounted.

8
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:52,730
Now for that reason since we're doing it here, we have the issue of not updating the price,

9
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:58,870
we can easily fix this. In the burger builder reducer when we call setIngredients and update the ingredients,

10
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:05,570
we simply also have to update the total price and we could get this value from a server too or we simply

11
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:13,940
hardcode it to form which is our initial price up here too. With that if we save this, now we will have an updated

12
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:14,420
price,

13
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:20,330
so now if I quickly build a delicious cheese bacon burger and just enter any data here to get the job

14
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:27,180
done, let's switch to dropdown to mix things up, if I order this, you see the price is now always reset and all

15
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,220
of that without any errors.

16
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:34,320
So with that we got the burger builder and the order workflow managed through redux,

17
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:41,090
now of course it's also time to work on the orders page. For that, I'll first of all clear all the orders

18
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,200
on firebase again.
