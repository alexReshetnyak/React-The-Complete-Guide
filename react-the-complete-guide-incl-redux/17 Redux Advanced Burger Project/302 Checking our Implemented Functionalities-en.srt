1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,070
We added a lot of functionality,

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:10,220
let's now see if that really all works. I'll build a new burger, the bacon cheese killer burger maybe,

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:11,810
no salad.

4
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:12,390
So let's click

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:13,430
continue here,

6
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:18,410
continue here and enter some contact data and I don't care about the data which is why I'm just rolling

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:19,470
over my keyboard.

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,820
So let's quickly add all that data

9
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,470
here, cheapest, click order.

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,500
So that is all working, let's click the orders page,

11
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:34,080
that looks a lot like the burger we just created, so that is all looking good.

12
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,550
Let's also scan that, we don't see any errors here

13
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:45,520
and if we have a look at firebase, there we also see both orders being placed, the order data also looks

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,450
good to me,

15
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,280
picks up what

16
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:52,420
we entered, the ingredients obviously are correct since we can see them on the orders page and this is

17
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,390
coming from the server.

18
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,720
So this is all working fine,

19
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,750
we got a nice working application.

20
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:05,050
Now you can definitely go ahead and and enhance this even more, you could add a delete button to get rid

21
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:06,100
of orders

22
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:13,540
but I want to focus on code enhancements and implement some of the things I touched on in the last module,

23
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:19,130
for example how we can make our reducers a bit leaner without splitting them up even more.

24
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,610
Let's focus on that over the next lectures.
