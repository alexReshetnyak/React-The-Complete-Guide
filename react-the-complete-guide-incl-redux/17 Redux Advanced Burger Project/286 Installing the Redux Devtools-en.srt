1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,980
First of all, I want to get start by cleaning up my firebase database.

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:12,220
I'm going to delete this orders node in our real time database here because I want to start from scratch

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:17,410
and get rid of all the old orders. I'll leave the ingredients here though because we'll soon go back

4
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:24,100
to fetching them from the server and not getting them or not having them stored locally in our store,

5
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:29,680
though only for demo purposes, in a real application that might of course also make sense to initialize

6
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,270
the ingredients in your code.

7
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,830
So with that let's see what we can do

8
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:39,320
and the first thing I actually want to do, I want to add to our code are the redux dev tools.

9
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:43,740
We installed that extension for the browser in the last module,

10
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:50,290
now we want to set up the store here in our burger builder application such that we can use the dev

11
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:55,910
tools there too because I want to be able to analyze my store. For that,

12
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:01,390
I'm back on the redux dev tools extension github page with the installation instructions and there's

13
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:07,050
one difference to the set up we used in the last module, though we'll go back to that set up from there.

14
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,140
Right now we don't use any middleware,

15
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:15,550
so we don't need the advance store set up where we need it to create this composeEnhancers constant and

16
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:22,440
use the native compose function or those special variable passed by the dev tools, since I got no other

17
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,090
enhancers

18
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,440
right now, we're not using any middleware yet,

19
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,730
we can go with the basic set up for now. Though as I just said, we're going to switch back to the advanced

20
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:36,130
set up soon because we're about to add middleware, with the basic set up however all we have to do is

21
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:40,900
add this argument here to our create store function call.

22
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:47,560
So accessing to special or actually it's one of the same, special variable on the window object which

23
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:55,770
is provided by the redux dev tools extension which we pass as a variable and then also execute as a function.

24
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:01,930
So this is simply something we have to add as a second argument to create store, redux dev tools extension

25
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:08,890
and executing it as a function. With this tiny change, if we save the index.js file and we go back

26
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:10,300
to our application,

27
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:20,800
we should already be able to open our dev tools and there, switch to redux and it should load our redux

28
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:26,650
inspector then, we should see init state and if I add an ingredient, we should see that add ingredient

29
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:27,540
action here,

30
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,490
of course the same for removing it.

31
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,800
And there we can also use time travelling,

32
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,040
so this is working great.

33
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,530
So here we got the functionality we want so that we're able to conveniently work with our application and

34
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:41,760
easily debug it and have a look at our current state.

35
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,230
So that's the first thing I wanted to do, with that out of the way,

36
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:53,020
let's dive into our actual business logic and let's start adding functionality to handle orders with

37
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,010
redux tool.
