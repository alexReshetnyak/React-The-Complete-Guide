00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:07,600
Welcome back to our course project, the burger builder where we already use redux,

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:14,590
we added it before but in the last module, we learned how to run asynchronous code and how to combine

3
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:15,750
that with redux

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:21,820
and learned a couple of other useful things too which I now also want to apply to our course project.

5
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,980
Right now, we only handle the building of the burger

6
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:25,870
via redux,

7
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:29,670
so we can add and remove ingredients and that's about it.

8
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,520
Obviously we got a whole checkout process

9
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:38,670
we can enter where we of course also want to make sure that we can store this new order we create here

10
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:45,040
once it was successfully stored on the server, also locally so that when we visit orders, we can see

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,360
it there for example.

12
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:52,210
These are all things we want to do, we want to make sure that works correctly and for that, we'll

13
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,220
need some advanced redux features

14
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,040
we learned about.

15
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:01,090
So in this module we're going to add them, we're going to add redux for handling our orders, for fetching

16
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:06,970
them from the server for example and we'll also optimize our reducers a little bit with all the tools

17
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,690
you learned about in the last course module.

18
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,880
So let's get started.
