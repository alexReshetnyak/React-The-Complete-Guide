Welcome to this module, throughout this course we used the create react app and the project created with it to work

2
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:14,690
in our react application, to build our react application.

3
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:21,690
I strongly recommend using create react app especially for single page applications, for multi-page

4
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:26,660
applications creating multiple apps for the different pieces although is viable

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:33,920
but there, you might have your old build workflow deeply integrated into your whole fullstack project anyways.

6
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:40,310
But for single page applications, create react app gives you an awesome workflow with a lot of next

7
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:47,780
generation features you can use, best practices when it comes to optimizing your code and much more. Still,

8
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:53,390
to understand what's happening behind the scenes and to get a deeper understanding of what the workflow

9
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,000
does for you,

10
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:58,910
I want to set up a basic workflow together with you in this module.

11
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:05,450
I'll introduce you to webpack, the core build tool which is used behind the scenes and we'll set a project

12
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:13,400
which actually supports the same code we wrote with the create react app application in our set up here.

13
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:18,480
So let's dive into that and let's start by understanding what exactly webpack is

14
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,170
since it seems to play a crucial role in the next lecture.
