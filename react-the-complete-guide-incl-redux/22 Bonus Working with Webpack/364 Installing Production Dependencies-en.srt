00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:08,220
In the last lecture I created a basic react application which you either now downloaded or where you

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,620
followed along,

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,850
now it's time to install some dependencies,

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:20,380
for example the react application obviously uses react or react-dom and the react router

5
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:24,140
so we should install all these production dependencies,

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:30,930
we do this with npm installed --save, not --save-dev because we want to indicate that

7
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:41,540
these are production dependencies and then it's react react-dom and react-router-dom, like this.

8
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:46,520
These three dependencies are all separated with white spaces and are now installed and therefore

9
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:52,550
placed into the node module folder, appropriate entries with the latest versions are also added to the

10
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:55,490
package.json file as you can see.

11
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,510
With that we installed react,

12
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,680
we did install webpack a while ago already,

13
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:07,130
we now need to install a couple of other dependencies to build a workflow and I will add them step by

14
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,080
step whenever we need them.

15
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:16,880
So what I want to do is I now want to start with setting up the webpack configuration such that it is

16
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,280
able to handle next generation javascript,

17
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,220
css, images and all that fun stuff.

18
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,800
Let's start with this in the next lecture.
