00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,160
So what is webpack?

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:12,770
Webpack is a bundler but it actually is more than that, a bundler alone would just concatenate files, webpack

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:13,710
does that

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:20,860
but it also allows you to optimize your files and you hook in various plugins and so-called loaders

5
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,260
to also transform your files

6
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:30,520
and for example transpile next generation javascript to current generation javascript. But in its core,

7
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:40,620
the idea behind webapck is to have multiple javascript, css, image, whatever files and bundle them together.

8
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:48,220
It analyzes connections between these files like imports and then bundles everything together, allows

9
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,410
you to optimize it

10
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:57,160
and as I said, allows you to also run some additional logic to transform your code or do whatever you

11
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,830
need to do with it.

12
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:06,450
This is what webpack does and webpack is the de-facto standard for setting up projects these days.

13
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:12,640
That's why we'll also use it in this module for setting up our own react workflow and project.
