1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:09,240
So over the course of this module, we built our own basic project setup with webpack as a build tool.

2
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,340
Now you can go into way more detail,

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,160
there's a lot you can configure,

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:18,450
you can add more loaders, more plugins and fine tune everything to your needs.

5
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,630
Definitely dive into the

6
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:27,570
e-check, that configuration we have for create react app, there you can have a look at the webpack config

7
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:32,650
they used when setting up the create react app config though it's a very elaborate and therefore

8
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,490
complex config.

9
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:38,800
This is a simpler one because I want you to understand how webpack works and what it does

10
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:44,440
and I hope this became a bit clearer over this module. Feel feel free to adjust and fine tune this

11
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:51,190
configuration and take it as a starting point for your next projects, always dive into the github pages

12
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:57,220
where you can find the documentations of the various loaders and plugins to really configure everything

13
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:58,620
as you need it.
