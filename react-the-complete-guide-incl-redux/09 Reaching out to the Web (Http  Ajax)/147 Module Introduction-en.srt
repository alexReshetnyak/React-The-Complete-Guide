Welcome to this module where we will learn how we can send HTTP requests from our react application

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:17,390
to a server because react of course is a library which allows you to create the frontend of your application.

3
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:22,530
Basically the html code, the thing the code running in the browser

4
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:27,660
and if you're creating a single page application, something you're often doing with react

5
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:35,720
then you have an even more decoupled application, more decoupled from your backend. Therefore it's of

6
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:42,200
course important to understand how you can actually send HTTP or since we have that decoupling

7
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:50,000
going on, ajax request specifically from your react frontend, from your javascript code to your server

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,800
side backend.

9
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,680
Now let me show you how this works in the next lecture

10
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:59,780
and then of course let me show you how to actually implement it into a react application

11
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,340
throughout this module.
