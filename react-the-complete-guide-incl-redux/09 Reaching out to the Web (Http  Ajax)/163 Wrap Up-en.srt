1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:07,920
So in this module we learned a lot about sending HTTP requests from react. You learned that it works

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:13,650
by sending Ajax requests and that it's best to use a package like axios. For axios, you learned how

3
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:20,700
it worked and that you can set some default configuration at interceptors or even split the configuration

4
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,790
with custom instances.

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,440
Now of course practicing always is the best thing you can do to get comfortable using a certain tool

6
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:36,730
and that is why in the next module, we will also add some HTTP functionality to our burger builer so

7
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:43,200
that when we click that order button, we really send a request to our server to at least fake that

8
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,660
we really placed an order.
