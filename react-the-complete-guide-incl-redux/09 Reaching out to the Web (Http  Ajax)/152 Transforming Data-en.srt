1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:08,210
In the last lecture we fetched some post data and we can render it to the screen by updating our state

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:14,990
but of course, we're fetching too many posts here. Now for a real application,

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,280
you probably can send some query parameter to your backend to restrict the amount of data you want

4
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,880
to fetch, some pagination basically.

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,370
But of course we can also transform the data once we got it,

6
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,160
so here I'll add a new constant posts,

7
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:36,300
and now in the then block of componentDidMount and then, I'll assign response data here.

8
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:43,380
Now I'll call the slice method on that array and only get the elements 1 to 4, to only fetch the first

9
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,600
four posts.

10
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:51,360
Actually I fetched them all but I only store 4 of them in that post constant, I'll then create a second

11
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,290
constant updatedPosts even, because I want to add an author field to my posts.

12
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,540
Now typically you would of course get this from your backend but our fake backend doesn't have that,

13
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:08,010
so I simply add here to also show you that of course, you can edit the data you fetch from the server,

14
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:13,090
we're just working with javascript in the end so we can add any javascript code we want.

15
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:22,920
So here I will take my posts, call the map method on them and for each post, I want to return a new javascript

16
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:30,610
object where I distribute the property of the post, so the properties we got from the server basically

17
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:38,640
and then also add a new author property which I'll hard code to Max. With that, I got the updated posts

18
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:42,660
now and I'll set the posts to my set state to them.

19
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:49,890
Now the data we get back from the server was shortened and also transformed in that we added the author field

20
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,170
and that of course is just one example transformation to showcase that you can of course work with

21
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,270
the data you will get back before setting it to the state. With that change in place,

22
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:05,990
we now got that author field, that also is a field of one output in that post element.

23
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,380
So there I expect to get

24
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,410
author prop,

25
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,100
I can now set this prop in the blog container, here

26
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:14,710
I can now

27
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:25,080
also pass this author should be post author, that author field we just added to each object we stored

28
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,230
in the state.

29
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:31,960
If we save this, we now see the author here and we see only four posts.

30
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:37,590
This is how you can transform the data, how you can work with the data in componentDidMount

31
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,520
in this example.
