00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:07,670
In the last lecture I showed you how to add interceptors. Now sometimes, you don't want to intercept

2
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:12,270
the request but you want to set up some global configuration.

3
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:18,420
Let's say the URL you are sending the requests to in your application is always the same,

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:25,040
so it's always jsonplaceholder.typeicode in our case here and then slash something.

5
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,840
So that starting part is always the same

6
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:34,040
so it would be nice if we could cut it out here and just send the request to get posts and automatically

7
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,980
append this to some comments starting URL.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,100
Turns out we can do that in the index.js file which is a good place because it runs first, it starts

9
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,160
to react app,

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:52,040
We can use axios and there access to defaults object to set up defaults which are true for all requests

11
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:59,600
which are being sent. And there we can define a baseURL and this URL will now be used, well

12
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,420
as the names suggests, as a baseURL to which the other paths are then simply appended.

13
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:11,110
Now with that set up here, whoops set by the way important should be baseURL with capital characters

14
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,650
here for the URL, casing is important here.

15
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:18,480
Now we already removed it from get all posts here in the block container,

16
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,730
now in new post, we can also get rid of it when posting data

17
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:31,760
and in the full post, there we have two places, one where we get to single post and one where we delete

18
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,550
the single post. So we can get rid of that starting URL everywhere and if we go back to the app, you

19
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:39,440
see it still loads, it still works,

20
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:47,810
everything still works fine here because we didn't really change the way we sent requests but we

21
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:52,750
made it a bit easier for us because of that global configuration.

22
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,560
Now you're also not limited to just setting the baseURL here,

23
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:05,030
you can also access defaults headers and there set a common header, so on that common object of authorization,

24
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:11,450
common headers are simply the general headers which are set for all types of requests, and there you could

25
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:15,730
set this to your auth token if you had one or whatever that is.

26
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:23,350
You can also set headers just for specific request types, like for post requests only where you maybe

27
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:30,110
want to set the content type you're sending to application.json, which you don't need to, that's the

28
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,160
default anyways, just to show this.

29
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:38,420
So now if you do this, if you go back to the application and you inspect the request which was sent, you

30
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:42,620
will see that under headers, we've got the authorization auth token

31
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:50,570
and for a post request here, if we do that, you will see that there if we inspect the request configuration

32
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,810
we got the authorization header and Content-Type

33
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,970
application.json.

34
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:58,280
So that's another cool feature of axios,

35
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,640
setting a default configuration which will be used application wide, super awesome,

36
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,140
helps you to optimize your code quite a lot.
