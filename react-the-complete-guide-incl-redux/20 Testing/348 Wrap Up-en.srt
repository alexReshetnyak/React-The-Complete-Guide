00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:07,580
Over this lecture, we had a brief introduction to testing in react apps and I did mention that you can

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:14,750
dive deeper, that there are whole courses or articles diving just into testing and I can only encourage

3
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,850
you to dive deeper if you want to learn more about testing,

4
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,680
this is just a rough introduction.

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:24,980
One of the most important things when it comes to testing is the way you think about tests,

6
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:32,990
don't test unnecessary stuff because that unnecessary stuff often is the most difficult to test, if you're

7
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:40,810
testing the whole workflow from I click a button to my state updates to then something changes in another

8
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,080
component,

9
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:48,500
then you won't have fun simulating that. That will require a lot of difficult work and code where you

10
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:54,350
need to mock the h to the p calls so that you don't actually reach out to the server during your tests

11
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,920
and all of that isn't fun at all.

12
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,970
And it's not only no fun, it's also redundant because we don't need to test if we can reach out to

13
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:02,860
the server,

14
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:06,620
we need to test does our reducer work correctly,

15
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,460
do we update our components correctly if the input changes,

16
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:15,630
maybe we want to test do we find a correct prop if we click a certain button.

17
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:20,210
All these things can be easily tested in isolated unit tests

18
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,290
and this really is the way to think about it

19
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,860
and the way I encourage you to practice.
