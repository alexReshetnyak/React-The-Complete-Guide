1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,970
So over the last lectures we wrote some tests,

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:08,910
now are these all the tests we can ride for navigation items?

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:14,180
They might be, we might also want to test the class we get here or something like that.

4
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:21,870
But in general this looks like a good test coverage for me, writing good tests is complicated,

5
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:28,600
it's easy to write 100 tests for a given component and test all kind of things while it's missing the one important

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:34,450
thing you should have tested and on the other way around, you might only need one test to really verify

7
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,870
if a component behaves the way you want it to behave.

8
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:43,870
Now I can only encourage you to just practice and write a lot of tests for different components, test

9
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:49,390
for different things no matter if they makes sense to be tested or not, learn how to test how to think

10
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:56,920
in test environments and learn how to use the different functions provided by enzyme and jest.

11
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:03,700
It really is all about practicing and testing takes experience, the best way to start with testing is

12
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:10,540
to always have a look at your component or your function or whatever you are testing and see what are

13
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:17,860
the crucial things that change depending on some external influences like here, the isAuthenticated part

14
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,790
which changes what gets rendered.

15
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:23,290
And then this should be what you write the test for,

16
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:29,290
so that whenever you change something in the navigation items component and you accidentally mess up like

17
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:36,490
here, if I remove the exclamation mark before this check, now we got failed tests if I save this component

18
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:40,510
because this also re-executes tests if you change your normal code

19
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,290
and now I got failed tests

20
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:49,540
and you see that here indeed, this should render three navigation items if authenticated fails, because now

21
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:56,230
we render a different amount, that by the way is referring to the third test where I didn't update my

22
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:56,870
naming,

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:06,590
this should of course showed an exact logout button. But still, the case holds true,

24
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,930
it fails here

25
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:12,030
and it also fails the previous test.

26
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:18,650
So always then have a look at your test errors and identify crucial parts just like that,

27
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,700
what can I easily break and what would then totally break my application behavior?

28
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,300
And then you write tests for exactly that.
