1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,220
So we learned that testing might make sense,

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,170
how do we test then?

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:13,370
We need two tools to write good tests and be able to test our react application.

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,270
The first tool is the test runner,

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,690
this is basically a tool which is responsible for executing our tests

6
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:27,720
so for running the code, test code and providing a validation library which in the end is a library which allows

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,610
us to do comparations and potentially throw some errors.

8
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:38,700
The idea behind unit tests is that they don't run in the browser but instead with nodeJS though often

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:45,530
emulated to be in a browser environment with the help of specific javascript packages. The test runner

10
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:50,360
then is the core tool which simply executes our code using that environment

11
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,140
and the good thing is create react app already comes with a pre-configured testing environment

12
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,510
we can build up on.

13
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:02,490
So that's the test runner and we will use jest in this course, jest is already installed in the app

14
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:08,460
created with create react app and is a popular javascript testing tool which is not limited to react

15
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:15,450
but often used in react apps. Now running the test is one thing, when working with reacting components,

16
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:22,380
we also need a way of emulating these components, so basically mounting them to some non-existent dom you

17
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:28,350
could say and then traversing our components and we want to do this in an efficient quick way without

18
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:34,340
having to actually create that whole component tree which might also introduce some side effects.

19
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:42,030
For this, we need testing utilities which help us with testing and there, we specifically need the just

20
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:48,510
described help to simulate the react app, mount components and dig into that dom which is created with react.

21
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:55,680
In this course we could you as react test utils, that's the official utility tool but there's another tool

22
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,160
which became more and more important and interesting and is also suggested by the react team

23
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,980
amd that's enzyme. Enzyme is a tool developed by AirBnB,

24
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:11,400
they use react in a lot of their projects and they share this tool which makes it easy to mount components

25
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,480
and then navigate through them

26
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,710
and I will of course show you how to use both tools, jest and enzyme in this course.

27
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,450
So these are the testing tools, that leaves us only with one question, what should we test?
