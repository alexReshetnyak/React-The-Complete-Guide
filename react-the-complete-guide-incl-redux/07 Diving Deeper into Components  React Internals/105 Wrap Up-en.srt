1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,860
In this module, we covered a lot,

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:11,110
a lot of theory, a lot of behind the scenes stuff, a lot of important things you have to know.

3
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:15,800
Now don't be shocked if that is not something you know by heart right now,

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:22,570
this was a lot of stuff and a lot of theory. It is important though because we're next going to dive

5
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:27,740
into our course project and we're using a lot of the things you learn thus far

6
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:32,210
and therefore it's so important that you understand how it's working behind the scenes.

7
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,830
Feel free to go back to some of the videos from this module.

8
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:42,680
It's perfectly fine if you need to go through some of them again and again to be sure about how this

9
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,860
shouldComponentUpdate thing worked, how the lifecycle works for updating

10
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:51,970
and don't be afraid of seeing all these concepts,

11
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,740
you might not use them all,

12
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,730
you might only use a few of them. But you get better and better

13
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:02,320
the more you learn about that and the more you question the approaches you use.

14
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,500
Maybe there are some advanced concepts you may use like a well-placed high order component or a pure

15
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,370
component.

16
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:15,040
And again, there is a course project into which will dive next where you will also see a lot of the things

17
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,310
you've learned thus far being used and hence there, you should also get a feeling for when to use what.

18
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:27,460
So with that let's dive into the course project and let's see more of these things in a bigger project

19
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,220
than the demo project we worked on thus far.
