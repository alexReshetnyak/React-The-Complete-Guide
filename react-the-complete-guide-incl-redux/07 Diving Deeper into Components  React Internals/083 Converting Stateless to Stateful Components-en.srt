1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:08,570
So I'm back in the project and I want to implement these methods so that we can see how our application

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,720
behaves.

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:13,140
And I only got one stateful component,

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:20,900
the app.js file, this is nice but to really see how all the child components get re-rendered, I also want

5
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:27,950
to turn some of them into stateful components so that we can implement these lifecycle methods because

6
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:32,010
that's an important takeaway. If you need access to a lifecycle method,

7
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:35,000
you need to have a stateful component.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,440
So a component created with class and by extending component,

9
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,330
you can't do this for functional components.

10
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:48,020
So for the sake of this, I'll turn persons and person into stateful components, I will quickly do this

11
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,870
for both and it's super easy to do. In the persons.js

12
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,540
file, we now no longer have a const persons,

13
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:00,010
we have a class and there the convention is to give this the component name but starting with a capital

14
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,850
character already.

15
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:09,620
Now this class should extend with the extends keyword component which you now need to import as a named

16
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:13,240
import from react, component like this.

17
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:20,870
Now a class then has a class body and in there, we will have this render method which we just saw on

18
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:24,780
the diagram and which we also saw earlier. In there,

19
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:30,670
we now want to return some jsx, so our list

20
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:37,700
and as you learn props is not available here, we'll have this.props. So wherever you use props, it should

21
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,720
be this.props now.

22
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:47,900
With that, I can remove the code down there and simply export Persons with a capital P, with that

23
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:51,050
let's quickly save this and let's see if our application still works,

24
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,110
Make sure npm start is still running,

25
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,500
and this looks good.

26
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:59,550
So now we turned our stateless component into a stateful component.

27
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:03,040
Let's do the same for the person component, there

28
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:10,800
we create a class, name it Person with a capital P, extend component which we then need to import as

29
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:18,450
a named import from react, define body for this class and add a render method to it.

30
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:28,520
And in there, simply return the jsx like this and make sure to adjust the default

31
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:36,670
export to use a capital P and as before, props doesn't exist,

32
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:40,030
This should be this.props,

33
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,730
Now we adjusted this too

34
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:45,020
and here there are two more.

35
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:52,760
Now with that, that all props are exchanged, with that, let's implement lifecycle hooks in the next lecture.
