00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:07,220
Now that we have learned about so many core features and basics of react,

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:14,780
it's time to dive deeper into components, after all components are the core building block and the feature

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,890
of the react library.

4
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:22,850
So we definitely have to make sure that we know how they work, what happens behind the scenes and what

5
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,070
we can do with them.

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,750
You already learn quite a bit about that but there still are some blind spots which are what I cover

7
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,310
in this module.

8
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:39,470
So let's dive deeper into components and not only the technical side but also how we may split our application

9
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,790
into components.
