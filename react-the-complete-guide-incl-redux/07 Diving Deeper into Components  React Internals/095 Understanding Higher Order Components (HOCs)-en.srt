1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:08,340
In the last lecture you'll learn that in react 16, you can actually return adjacent elements in some

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,800
circumstances. For one of the circumstances props children,

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,110
we created this auxiliary component

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:22,500
and I told you that it's a higher order component called like this because all it does is it basically

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:29,320
wraps another component, doesn't really do much else but does something with that wrapping component,

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:35,940
in this case simply output it with props children so that we can use this advantage or take advantage

7
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,800
of this new feature of react 16.

8
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:44,520
Now you can also create higher order components and by the way you will often use some when using third

9
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,040
party packages

10
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:52,860
that add a certain logic to a component. Some logic you might need in multiple components which you don't

11
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,410
want to write into each of them,

12
00:00:54,630 --> 00:01:01,120
for example share a logged in user, you will see some higher order components throughout this course,

13
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:07,050
let's add one for our demo project here though. For the person.js component,

14
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:17,290
we wrap it in a div with classes, person as a class name, in app.js we do the same, a div with classes

15
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,490
app

16
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:23,490
but it would be cool if we could use a higher order component which does that,

17
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:31,990
now there are actually two approaches we could take, I'll show both. The first one is the maybe with class.js

18
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:40,270
file which is a constant withClass equal to

19
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:51,270
function of course where all we do is we return some jsx where we have this wrapping div and there,

20
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:59,640
we might set a class name, receive props classes, this is the expectation of this component and then output

21
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:04,510
props children in between.

22
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:11,520
Next we of course need to import react from react because this will be transformed to react create

23
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,730
element and then export default withClass.

24
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,640
Now we can use the with Class wrapper here,

25
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:30,780
for example in the app.js file, let's quickly import it, let's import with class from up one level hoc with

26
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,830
class

27
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,910
and now, let's wrap it.

28
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:39,490
So let's wrap our component with the withClass component, here

29
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:45,220
we now have withClass and close with class.

30
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,140
So we replace the div with it

31
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:54,310
and as we configured withClass, we expect to get classes as a property.

32
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:59,530
So we should pass this, props children of course is the part we passed between the opening and closing

33
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:08,670
tags, so this part, but we need the class property and this should of course be classes app.

34
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:14,840
So we basically replaced the div which has class name with withClass which is classes so we saved

35
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,980
a few characters which we then spanned instead of the div.

36
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:23,300
Still it's a nice example for one possible higher order of component,

37
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:28,900
it doesn't do anything than wrap the content in a div and assign this css class.

38
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:37,420
If we now save this, get the same styling and behavior as before with withClasses and of course we can also

39
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:42,600
add this to person where we have the same behavior,

40
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,130
a wrapping div.

41
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,160
Let's quickly do this, let's import withClass here too,

42
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:51,370
let's go up a couple of levels until we reach the top level,

43
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:58,120
go to hoc, import with class and then again as before in the app.js file,

44
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:03,730
replace this div here with withClass and class name

45
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,030
now with classes because it is the property withClass expects.

46
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:13,870
And now with that, if we relaod this, get the same styling as before with our custom higher order component.
