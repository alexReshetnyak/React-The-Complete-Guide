00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:10,810
One more information about the links you set up here, to='/', to='/new-post', the way you write your

2
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:11,890
links here

3
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:15,370
doesn't the fact whether it's an absolute or relative path.

4
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,930
Now what does absolute and relative mean anyways?

5
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:23,310
An absolute path is always appended to your domain,

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:29,720
so if you're serving this app from example.com then you want to go to new-post,

7
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:37,360
if you navigate to /new-post, that simply means always attach /new-post right after the domain.

8
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:45,430
Even if you previously were at example.com post, you wouldn't add new-post at the end of that, turning

9
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,890
it to posts/new-post but turning it into example.com/new-post and omitting posts,

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,550
this is what an absolute path does.

11
00:00:54,550 --> 00:01:00,260
Now when setting up to, you can't control whether it's an absolute or relative path,

12
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:06,620
it's always treated as an absolute path. So no matter if it's /new-post or just new posts,

13
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:11,420
it's an absolute path and will always be appended to your root domain.

14
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:15,990
Now what if you wanted to turn this into a relative path though?

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,080
So if you wanted to make sure that if you are on your domain/posts, you actually go to your domain

16
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:28,640
/posts/new-posts so you append this to the end of the current path.

17
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:35,650
Then you actually need to build this path dynamically by taking into advantage that you know at which

18
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:37,810
path you are currently on.

19
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:41,230
Remember that you have access to this.props.match,

20
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:48,620
we inspected this in the console. The match object has the URL object which is the currently loaded path

21
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,010
in the end.

22
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:56,860
Now you can chain /new-post to this, you can build a dynamic path like this.

23
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,470
Now it's a relative one because it takes the page you're currently on,

24
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:07,480
the path you're currently on and appends this at the end and all of a sudden, you built a relative

25
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,210
path.

26
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:15,110
So if you ever want to build a link which simply appends the path to the end of the current path,

27
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,730
use this approach

28
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,650
otherwise, this always generates an absolute path.

29
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,910
There is no better or worse here,

30
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:30,060
it really depends on which behavior you want, add it to the root domain or appended to the current path,

31
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:32,470
I wanted to make you aware how to achieve both.
