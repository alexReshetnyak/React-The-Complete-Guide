1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:05,560
So now we're successfully passing parameters and using them,

2
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:09,380
let me now go back to that Posts component again.

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:15,830
Right now we're using a link to load a single post and navigate to its page and there's nothing wrong

4
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:17,190
with that,

5
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:24,320
however I now want to show you an alternative and for this, I'll comment out the link path here with a

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,470
normal comment because I'm not inside jsx here. So I don't wrap this in a link,

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,520
therefore I need to add the key to post again because now post is again the topmost element in our

8
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,770
array we're returning.

9
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,490
But now I'm not using link any more

10
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:46,760
and I can therefore remove the import and actually remove the whole import statement,

11
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,220
I have to find some other way of going to that post

12
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:56,150
and remember that we have this clicked listener where we execute this postSelectedHandler where we

13
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,960
also pass the ID.

14
00:00:58,370 --> 00:00:59,710
We can use that method

15
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,950
and here I don't want to use the state, instead

16
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,230
I want to navigate programmatically

17
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:10,070
and I was showing this here as a demo. Of course using the link would be fine for this use case but you

18
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:16,640
also sometimes have use cases where you want to navigate after something finished, after a HTTP request

19
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,060
was sent

20
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,080
for example, we'll see this again later.

21
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:25,770
Now to do this, we can take advantage of that history object we received on the props,

22
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:32,600
remember here in the props we got history and there we actually have some functions we can execute, functions

23
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,690
for navigating around like go back or go forward, which do exactly what they sound like, they basically

24
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:41,910
do the same you have with the forward and backward buttons.

25
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:50,360
There also is this push method which allows you to push a new page onto the stack of pages because navigation

26
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,860
basically just is about a stack of pages.

27
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:59,420
That is why the back and forward buttons work in the browser because you can go back to the last page

28
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:05,100
on the stack or forward again to that page on the stack you had on the top of it

29
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,330
before you went back.

30
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:12,160
So therefore we can use this.props.history.push

31
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:23,690
and then a string or also an object, so essentially the same we use in router link on the to property

32
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,080
to navigate to a page.

33
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:36,300
So there we could navigate to a javascript object where I set pathname to slash and then plus the ID,

34
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:41,650
and this is just the same I had down there with link to, just using the object notation

35
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:48,350
but again the alternative which I'll comment out would be to just go to slash plus ID,

36
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:52,220
so just passing a string. So both will work now

37
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,560
and with that,

38
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:59,910
if I go back to my application to home and I click on a post, that still works.

39
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:07,430
Now however programmatically and just to demonstrate that it does work even or also with the other notation, let

40
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,690
me comment it this way.

41
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:15,000
Now if I go back to home and click on a post, we still go to that post.

42
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:21,950
So now we're navigating programmatically which can be important from time to time mostly used after

43
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,730
a given operation finished.
