1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:06,990
So in the last lectures we restructured our project to have different pages,

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:10,780
now I no longer want to render posts all the time,

3
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:18,820
I want to load this dynamically depending on the path we have in the URL and for /nothing.

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:26,110
So for essentially localhost:3000/ in our case here or whatever our domain then in the end is, I

5
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:29,190
want to load the postS component.

6
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:35,430
Now we already turned on routing in the app.js by wrapping everything with the browser router,

7
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:42,670
Now in the blog component where I want to load my different pages, I need to import something else from

8
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,270
the router package.

9
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:46,880
So from react-router-dom

10
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:56,980
again because it is related to rendering, from there I want to load the route object, the route component

11
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,110
to be precise.

12
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:04,400
Now we use it like any other component in our jsx code and it's a self-closing component.

13
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:12,460
Route needs some configuration though, route needs a path property and all these props here I'm setting

14
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:18,910
up are of course reserved words kind of, they are expected to be named like this by this component

15
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:24,140
so you can't change the name and path simply is a string.

16
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:31,720
Here you define the path for which this route should become active, something like path/,

17
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:36,880
then you need to define what should happen when this is the active path,

18
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:46,470
So when react router finds out that this is the active path. Now in its simplest form, you can now add

19
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:53,800
a render prop which actually holds a reference to a function and you can pass an anonymous function

20
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,510
an arrow function here.

21
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,910
So here this function then has to return jsx which should be rendered,

22
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:05,600
so you could simply render something like h1 tag where you say home

23
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:11,970
and of course you can also render structured jsx here by wrapping it in parentheses and writing multi-line

24
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,140
just like you write

25
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:13,630
jsx

26
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,020
anywhere else.

27
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:21,170
If you save that code and go back to your application, you actually see home here.

28
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:29,160
You also see that though if you visit new post, the reason for this is that react router

29
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,640
to determine which path you're on

30
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:36,270
sees if your current path starts with this path.

31
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:43,240
So if this is a prefix, you can override this behavior by adding one more prop which is exact,

32
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,380
that's a boolean prop so just adding it like this sets it as true, the

33
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:48,840
default when it's not

34
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,580
added is false.

35
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:58,950
Now with exact for new post new you no longer is see home, you'll only see for the home page where indeed

36
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,420
the full path is slash

37
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,090
so that already is an important take away.

38
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:08,110
You use the path here to tell react router

39
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,900
does my path start with this? Except for the case that you define exact,

40
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,510
then the question would be

41
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:18,420
is my complete path like this?

42
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:24,990
And then here render determines what the react router should render to the screen in this component's

43
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:28,710
place here, so route simply replaces itself

44
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:36,120
you could say with the content you define here and you can of course use multiple routes, even for the

45
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,460
same path.

46
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:41,410
So here I simply duplicated it and render something different

47
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:48,250
and now if I save this we render both home and home 2 beneath each other.

48
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,800
So you can use route anywhere where you want, beneath each other,

49
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,790
you could also nest the second route into a div,

50
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,080
you can use as many routes on the same page as you want,

51
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,730
react router will for

52
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:05,100
each of them check if this criteria here is met.

53
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,880
So if this criteria here is met, so

54
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:15,360
if path is the current path or if you don't specify exact, if it is the prefix of the current path and

55
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,680
then render this content.

56
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,560
This is the core functionality of the router thus far

57
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,450
and here for example where I removed exact on a second route,

58
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,620
if we save this we still see both

59
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:37,530
but if we go to New post there we only see home 2 because the first home element has exact and therefore

60
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:41,990
the full path has exact and therefore the full path is evaluated

61
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,350
which of course is new post now.

62
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:51,810
The second route however doesn't use exact, so the path only needs to start with slash and every path starts

63
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:52,650
with slash

64
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,100
so this will then always be rendered.

65
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,020
So this is the core functionality of the router,

66
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:04,140
Of course we don't want to render jsx in our case, though that might of course be what you want to do

67
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,410
in some cases.

68
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,730
We want to load one of our components,

69
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,210
the Post component for just path.

70
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:16,730
So let's make sure we load this component in the next lecture.
