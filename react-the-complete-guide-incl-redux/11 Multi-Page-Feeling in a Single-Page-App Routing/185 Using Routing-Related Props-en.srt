1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:05,970
Right now in our application we are able to navigate around,

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:10,330
We are able to do that without reloading the page.

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:15,690
Now let's have a look at the information we actually get in the components we're loading because react

4
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,240
router gives us some extra information about the loaded route through props.

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:26,340
Let's have a look at posts, there in componentDidMount which will be executed each time we changed a page

6
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:30,690
because the component is really removed and added to the DOM all the time.

7
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:33,610
There we not only reach out to the web,

8
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:40,720
let's also output the props we have by simply outputting these props.

9
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,080
Now let's have a look at what we got here,

10
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:49,100
if I go to home now, this is the props object and history, location and match,

11
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,280
this is not something we set up,

12
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,520
this is passed by react router.

13
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:54,260
Now match

14
00:00:54,260 --> 00:01:01,130
gives us some information about the matched route, you saw that we defined it to be exact the path and

15
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:07,340
URL are found therefore and potential params, I'll come back to what params are later.

16
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:13,210
You get more information about the location and there you see for example the search

17
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:19,880
params we set up or something like that at the hash fragment and the history. The history object also

18
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:28,040
has some methods we can use like push to interact with that and push a new page programmatically without

19
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,660
needing a link component,

20
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,420
this is also something I will show you later.

21
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:39,640
Now let's go back to our components and let's also log the props in the new post,

22
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:46,650
there we also therefore can add componentDidMount and inside there,

23
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:52,590
I now also want to output the props because there we should see more information regarding the fragment

24
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,160
and the search params.

25
00:01:54,210 --> 00:02:01,700
So let's click on new post and inspect the props there and now you'll see under match the path we found there,

26
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,830
you see that it also is exact match.

27
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,460
Now we didn't set up exact matching here,

28
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:11,340
we don't have the exact option but we are on new post.

29
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:18,900
If I were on new post 2, I added this manually. It would still render this because we didn't set up exact

30
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:25,410
matching but it would also see that we don't have an exact match in the match property.

31
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:29,450
So this really tells us is the full URL the full path,

32
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,980
the path we set up in the config or not? We also got more information on the location.

33
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:40,500
You'll see the search addition you added at the end and you could manually parse this to retrieve the

34
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,400
query params

35
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:47,590
and you see your hash fragment too which you could then also use to jump to a certain part of your page or

36
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,380
as smoothly scroll there whatever you want.

37
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,130
So this is some additional information we get,

38
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:01,530
this is part of the props and you can use that to for example extract your query params, move to

39
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:05,060
a hash fragment or do whatever else you need to do.

40
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:10,350
We will later see how we used this history object to use a method that provides us.
