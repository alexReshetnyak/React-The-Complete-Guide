1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:06,600
So I want to leave the realm of Route parameters and so on soon.

2
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:13,360
One more thing I want to do though, we have that home link which is not marked as active when being

3
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:17,150
on a single post and it kind of makes sense by the label of it.

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,910
But what if this was named posts which would make sense because we have a lot of posts there

5
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,720
so let's maybe rename that link to be posts.

6
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:34,410
If we do this, now it will be strange that it's not highlighted when we are on a single post,

7
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:43,420
we certainly would want this. Now the reason for this of course is exact, since exact is set, this only is

8
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:48,570
treated as active if we well have exactly this

9
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:55,040
URL is just slash and not slash three which we have of course for the post with ID.

10
00:00:55,060 --> 00:01:01,150
The problem is that if we remove exact what we saw that before, now it will be marked as active for

11
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:04,810
a single post but also for a new post.

12
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:11,340
So this is kind of tricky and it's only really tricky for this exact case that we're talking about,

13
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,010
the root URL.

14
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:19,600
If we had /posts then it will be a different story and we could absolutely use this prefix because

15
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,760
we probably have no conflicts with our routes in the application.

16
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:30,850
It's really just that root URL, this root path of just slash which happens to be part of any page

17
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,060
in our app.

18
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,610
So this is just an edge case here, a special case and I'm going to add exact again

19
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,720
therefore not getting highlighting for a single post.

20
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,120
And again it is fine for me because this is an edge case which you will rarely face.

21
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:53,950
Most of the time your posts are going to be at slash posts and I'm just not changing it here to deliberately

22
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,200
leave this edge case here for reference.

23
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,450
I just wanted to bring this to your awareness,

24
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:03,130
you can face issues when using the root path,

25
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:08,190
Just slash and you want to style some child components but not all of them,

26
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:11,550
so some paths which follow it but not all paths,

27
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,210
this is really tricky to do,

28
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:14,580
not really possible.

29
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:20,510
You typically use more specific routes like /posts though so this shouldn't be an issue.
