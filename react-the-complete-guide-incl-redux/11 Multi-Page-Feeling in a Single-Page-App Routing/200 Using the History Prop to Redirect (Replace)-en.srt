00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,370
In the last lecture we learn how to conditionally redirect

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:12,020
and that is a nice way of redirecting. Now to be honest, the way we redirect in the new post component

3
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:19,560
is maybe not the way you're always going to do that. In the end after submitting a post successfully,

4
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:26,090
you just want to switch to page and for that you can of course also use that history prop which you

5
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:35,240
get on every component which is loaded inside a browser router wrapped component and new post is

6
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,680
in the end loaded through blog

7
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:43,280
so therefore it is wrap by browser router. In there, we have access to that match location and history

8
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,070
prop I showed you earlier

9
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:51,260
and that history prob has a couple of convenience methods we can use for replacing the current route

10
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,170
or pushing a new route.

11
00:00:53,540 --> 00:01:02,330
So we can also change the page here without changing the state and therefore by never rendering that

12
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:09,740
redirect component but instead by accessing this.props.history and there the push method which allows

13
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,330
us to push a new page.

14
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:18,130
So here we could also go to /posts and this will essentially lead to the same behavior as before.

15
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,570
We can go to new posts,

16
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:27,780
we can enter a new post and once this is done, we push a new page and we are redirected. Technically

17
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,850
push pushes this page onto the stack,

18
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:37,670
so if we click the back button, we go back to the new post page. Whereas redirect replaces current

19
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:38,290
page

20
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:42,700
so if we then click the back button and you can of course try this out after you comment this in

21
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:48,330
again, if you click the back button after redirecting and not by pushing,

22
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:54,830
you can go back but you won't go back to the last page because redirect replaces the current page on

23
00:01:54,830 --> 00:02:00,290
a stack, it doesn't push a new one. Though you can also replicate this behavior by not using push

24
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,750
but replace here on the history object. If you use that,

25
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,350
you go to new post, if you now enter something here,

26
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:12,320
we also leave the page but now if we press the back button

27
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:19,940
we're still on post because we were there before we visited new post, because new post was replaced on

28
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,460
a stack of pages.

29
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:27,650
So replace basically does the same as redirecting and therefore you can use it as an alternative.

30
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,780
I wanted to show you both methods though because maybe you have a use case where you want to render

31
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,070
that redirect component conditionally

32
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,720
and then this is an easy way of doing it.

33
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:44,360
If you don't want to use the approach of rendering that component, replace or push also is a way

34
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,630
of changing the page after some operation finished.
