1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:06,770
In this module, we're going to turn our heads towards a very important features

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,870
you probably are going to add to a lot of the react applications

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,650
you're about to build. Now

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:19,920
one important thing, routing, what this module is about is not built into the core of react. We'll use

5
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:26,740
another package which is not created by Facebook but the de-facto standard for this task

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,310
in this module,

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,800
so that's important. React at its core is just a component creation library,

8
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:41,160
now we're turning it to much more like a framework by adding a major feature, routing. This of course

9
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,580
leads to one question,

10
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,300
what is routing?

11
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:49,110
Let's answer this and let's then learn how to implement it in the next lectures.
