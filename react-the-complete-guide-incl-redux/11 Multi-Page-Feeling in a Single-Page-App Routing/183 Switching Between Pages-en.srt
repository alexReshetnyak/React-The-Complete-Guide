1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:09,070
Now that we learned how to load components, let's add more routes here to load different components like new

2
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:16,260
post component. So I'll simply duplicate my path here and now looking for new post and here we could

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:23,910
also remove exact because maybe we want to handle all routes starting with /new-post with that

4
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,670
or you leave exact if you really only want to handle /new-post and not

5
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,540
/new-post one

6
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:37,030
And now here, the component of course is not posts but a component we have to import,

7
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:44,900
we have to import new post from of course /new-post new post/newposts.js just like this.

8
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:52,480
Now let's grab new post here and add it like this, NewPost, save this.

9
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,300
Now you see we see the posts here

10
00:00:54,450 --> 00:01:00,250
but if I click on new post, we see the new post component and not our posts, this

11
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,070
is already showing you how routing works.

12
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,180
Right now our application has an issue though, we can click these links

13
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:15,120
they are normal anchor tags but each time our application actually reloads, as can see if you watch the

14
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:15,770
reload

15
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,170
icon next to the URL bar.

16
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,600
Now this is not a problem here

17
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:27,450
but theoretically a reloading application means that your javascript code is starting anew and therefore

18
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,140
all previous application state is lost.

19
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:37,940
This is rarely what you want in your react application, as long as the user is navigating around in it,

20
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:44,940
you want to not reload the page, you want to just re-render the page in the parts where it needs to be

21
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,880
re-rendered to look like the new page.

22
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,490
So we need to change to behaviour so that we don't have a normal link here which reloads the page but

23
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:59,910
that instead we prevent the rebuilding of the page and let react router only re-render parts of the

24
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:06,090
dom or tell react what to re-render to be precise that needs to be re-rendered.

25
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:13,560
So let's in the next lecture find out how we can make sure that we stay inside of our application and

26
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,090
don't reload it all the time.
