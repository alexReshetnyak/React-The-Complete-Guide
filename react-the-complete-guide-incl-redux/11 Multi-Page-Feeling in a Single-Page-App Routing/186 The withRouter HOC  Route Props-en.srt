1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:07,680
In the last video we learned about the props we can output, this utility information

2
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:14,540
and regarding the history object, the utility methods even we can use to navigate around or find out where

3
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,080
we are at. Now

4
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:22,930
what if we actually want to get this information not in one of our containers,

5
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:31,820
so not in a component which was loaded through a route as defined in the blog.js file but in a component

6
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:38,390
which is rendered as part of such a container, like the Post's container. The post container is loaded

7
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:46,190
with this route here in the blog container and the post container simply renders the post component

8
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,200
then.

9
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:57,080
Now if we go into that post component and for a second we turn this post component into a component

10
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:01,760
where we actually return jsx like this.

11
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,150
If we dare

12
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:06,320
now console log the props,

13
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:12,640
then you will actually see that the props in the post components we see that four times because we're

14
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,710
rendering four posts is just author, clicked, title,

15
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:24,560
There is no match, location, history prop in there as we have it in the posts component, plural, not the single

16
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,700
one.

17
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:34,100
So the routing relay the props are not passed down the component tree, we can't access them in components

18
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:39,980
which we simply embed as part of the jsx code of a container.

19
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:45,440
Now if you wanted to use the props there, there are two ways to get access,

20
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:53,680
one of course is we can pass them on with the spread operator and this props, this passes any props

21
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:57,590
this post container has onto the post component.

22
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:03,560
Of course we could also explicitly target certain props like for example if you want to pass on the

23
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,890
matched property,

24
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:08,320
We could also do this.props.match.

25
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,500
Now this is one way of passing it on

26
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,820
but there also is a higher order component we can use on the post component, there

27
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:24,050
we can import something which is called withRouter from react-router-dom.

28
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:32,070
Now withRouter is a higher order component which we use by wrapping our export with it, just like that.

29
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:40,310
With this added, if we now save all files you see that now that the props are out for for the individual

30
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:45,030
posts, they do have a history location and match property.

31
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:52,990
So withRouter adds these props to other components, to any component we wrap with it.

32
00:02:53,300 --> 00:03:00,560
So withRouter is a nice way of making that component route aware and it will use or it will get the props

33
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:05,240
containing information for the nearest loaded route.

34
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:11,840
So in this case since post is included in posts, we get the same props as we receive in posts.

35
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:18,170
I'm going to remove it here but this is one way for you to get access to routing related props which

36
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:25,910
you might need for calling push on the history prop or for getting information about the loaded route.

37
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,980
This is one way of getting access

38
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:35,420
using this approach of accessing props with the higher order component here.

39
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,060
Now again I'm removing it here

40
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:40,490
so I'm going back to the original state for my post component.

41
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,780
I just wanted to share this with you.
