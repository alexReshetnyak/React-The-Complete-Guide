00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:07,210
In the last lecture, we use the router to render some jsx code.

2
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:13,840
and you also learned about exact and that you can render as many routes here as you want.

3
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:20,980
Now in this lecture I want to adjust this, I'll comment it out and by the way, you comment in jsx by using

4
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:27,670
a blog comment with /* and wrapping this in curly braces. And now I'll add another route where the

5
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,690
path should also be /.

6
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:38,260
I'm looking for an exact match and now however I don't want to use render, I want to use a different

7
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,950
property I can pass,

8
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:46,420
I want to use the component property and as the name suggests, this allows us to pass a component which

9
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,390
should be rendered in this route's place.

10
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:55,260
Now component is not a string so we don't write posts here, that wouldn't work,

11
00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:02,180
component needs to be a reference to the function or class we want to use.

12
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:09,910
So here simply to what we import from the post component what we previously directly used in jsx.

13
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:14,060
we simply parsed this in curly braces like that

14
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:21,610
and now if I save this and we have a look at our application and we go back to just slash, we do see

15
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,280
all the posts loading up here.

16
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:32,020
So this now shows us how we can load components just like with render but with the component property.

17
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:38,380
Obviously this is the use case you're probably going to use a bit more, render is most important for

18
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,570
short info messages.

19
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:45,640
You shouldn't really render a whole component's code here even though you could technically do that

20
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:52,360
but that will mess up your code, will make it very hard to maintain but loading components like this

21
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,330
here that is the default case which will use a lot.
