00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:04,790
In the last lecture, we learned about redirect,

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:08,130
now let me show you another usage of redirect

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:13,790
actually in the new post component. There, we probably want to redirect

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:21,600
once we clicked the submit button your and once we made our HTTP request. We often then want to change

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,490
the page and not remain on that page. Using the redirect component

6
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:27,940
we can easily do that,

7
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:36,470
we can import redirect from react-router-dom just like before.

8
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:43,320
Now if we place redirect in jsx here outside of a switch statement, we always have to redirect with the

9
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,970
to property though, we can't use from.

10
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,240
So here we could redirect to /posts,

11
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:57,690
for example. The issue with that of course is now if I save a code like this, if we click onto new post

12
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:04,190
we are immediately redirected back to posts because the redirect component is rendered and when whenever

13
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,600
this is rendered, it redirects us,

14
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,480
so we have no chance of entering content.

15
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,500
Therefore we need to render this conditionally

16
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:20,130
and since it's a normal component as all of js react router is, we just have to render it conditionally

17
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,400
as we render any other content conditionally.

18
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,500
So we could add a new state here

19
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:31,590
maybe submit it which initially is false which we then set to true

20
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:40,210
once we made the HTTP request. So there I'll call setState and set submitted to true.

21
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:45,180
Now I can use submitted to determine whether or not to render redirect,

22
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:51,060
so in the render method I could have a redirect variable which is null by default.

23
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:59,390
But then I check if this.state.submitted is true and if it is, then redirect is equal to that redirect

24
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:06,290
component, and then I return jsx which includes that redirect variable which is either null or

25
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,850
redirect component.

26
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:16,640
If we save that code, we can successfully go to new post but as soon as I do submit a post and it is hitting

27
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,840
the server, I am redirected with a conditional redirect.

28
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:26,310
Now this is our way of using redirect outside of a switch statement,

29
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:30,460
not with from, but instead the conditioned just is

30
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:37,700
did something happen so that I want to render this component? And then we only render it when we want

31
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,750
to redirect.

32
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:45,440
Might feel strange at first that we render a component to leave the page but this is just how it works.
