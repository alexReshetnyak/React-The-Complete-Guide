00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:08,890
So enough about route parameters and nested routes, let's talk about redirecting the user.

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,190
Sometimes you want to redirect the user,

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:18,350
for example, let's say that you also want to lead the user to /posts,

4
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:25,280
if he visits just slash. Of course you can duplicate that route and also handle the slash case here,

5
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:29,780
in this case, you could render component posts.

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:36,640
Now if you save this and you reload the page, you'll see that you load the posts component

7
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:44,480
even if you go onto just slash without /posts and if you then click on a post, the link still leads

8
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,900
to /posts /id

9
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,340
so now you're back to the old rule.

10
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,590
This of course works and there's nothing wrong with it,

11
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:56,930
you can definitely have multiple routes with different paths which render the same content,

12
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,090
that's absolutely fine.

13
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:03,950
I'm still going to comment this out because I want to show you a different solution.

14
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:12,470
You can also use a special component provided by react-router-dom, the redirect component.

15
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:19,570
The redirect component as it is a component is simply used in your jsx code, there

16
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:27,860
you can add it to your switch statement and then you specify a from property, so from which route you

17
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:36,960
want to navigate to which. For example, from / to /posts and then it's a self-closing component.

18
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:44,300
If you use it outside of the switch statement, from can't be specified, then you can just always redirect

19
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:49,630
to switch /posts and not respect the path you were navigating to.

20
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,770
I'll come back to conditional redirects outside of switch in the next lecture though.

21
00:01:54,980 --> 00:02:00,670
So now we have that redirect statement in the switch statement and it's just like another route,

22
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:08,060
the only difference is it doesn't render content, it simply just changes the URL so that we then reach

23
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:11,380
another route for which we render content.

24
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:19,520
If you save all of that and we now load the root URL again, you'll see that URL changes to

25
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,940
/posts because we are redirected.

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:31,130
This is how we can redirect to ensure that the user is removed or is navigated to the route we

27
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,580
want to have him on.

28
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,310
That's redirection,

29
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,210
however I just mentioned that there also is some conditional redirection we can use,

30
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,590
let me show you what I mean with that in the next lecture.
