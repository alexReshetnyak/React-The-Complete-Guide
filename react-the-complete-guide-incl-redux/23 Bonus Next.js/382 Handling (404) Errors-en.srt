1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:03,670
So we learned quite a bit about nextjs

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:10,820
and I'm already nearing the end of this module since it is again not a full nextjs course

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,110
but there still are some things I want to touch on.

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:21,450
Let's go back to the github page of nextjs and if we scroll to the summary here, to the content we can

5
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,500
go through, there

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:29,520
we can also have a look at custom error handling because right now, we already have routes in our nextjs

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,440
application

8
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:37,920
but if I enter an invalid route here, we get this default 404 error, better than nothing but we can customize

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:45,270
this. As described here in the github repository of nextjs, you can create your own error handler

10
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,770
by creating an _error.js

11
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,470
file in the pages folder.

12
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:56,350
So let's do that, in pages let's create error.js with the underscore at the beginning

13
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:00,680
and that is a normal javascript react component.

14
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,840
So let me copy the content from index.js

15
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:08,550
and I'll name this error page but the name of course doesn't really matter

16
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:14,690
and then I can say, whoops something went wrong

17
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:23,660
and maybe here, we say try and then on the link, we say going back. So we still import the link, don't need

18
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,510
the button though so

19
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:29,280
let's also get rid of router import and on the link, I want to go to just slash.

20
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:37,200
If we now restart npm run dev, we need to do that because we exchanged that error page and therefore

21
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,820
we overwrote the default,

22
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:44,610
now if we enter a route we don't know, we get our custom error page and now we can go back to our main

23
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,540
page and it automatically continues working thereafter.

24
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:54,900
So this is how we can handle errors in nextjs and how we can render our own custom error page which of

25
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,610
course is quite important

26
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,460
if we really want to build a real application with that.
