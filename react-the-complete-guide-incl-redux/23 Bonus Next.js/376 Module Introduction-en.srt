Welcome to this module, in this module I'll have a look at nextjs and give you a first short introduction

2
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:16,450
to it. NextJs is a library building up on react and you'll still be writing a react application

3
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:16,810
with it,

4
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:20,250
it's not an extra library framework or syntax.

5
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:20,920
NextJS

6
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:27,100
instead enforces a specific folder structure you have to use and gives you some things like server

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:32,380
side rendering out of the box. Since you use that folder structure, it can manage a lot of things for

8
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:37,560
you so that you don't have to configure them manually and therefore it can making the creation of react

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:45,580
ups more convenient especially the server side rendering part. Server side rendering is a super interesting

10
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:51,700
part of react what you might not need but which can be helpful if you have an application that is this highly

11
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,410
dependent on being found in search engines, for example.

12
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,510
So that's nextjs

13
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:57,490
in a nutshell.

14
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,830
Now let's walk through it step by step in this module

15
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:06,860
and of course keep in mind, it's only an introductory module will not cover all features of nextjs here

16
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,060
but the important core concepts.

17
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,430
So let's dive into it.
