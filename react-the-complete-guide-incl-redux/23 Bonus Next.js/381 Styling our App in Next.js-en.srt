1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:06,280
So now we had a look at how nextjs works and how we work with components in

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:12,680
nextjs, how we can build our react application with nextjs in its core basics.

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,340
Now what about styling? In create react app,

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,960
we use css modules but I taught you that you have other options too.

5
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:29,140
What do we actually do when you're working with nextjs? Nextjs has its own way of styling

6
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:29,940
react,

7
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:37,440
you can still use inline styles, you can still use radium, css modules,

8
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:44,290
you can't use that here because you can't access the webpack configuration nextjs uses but it offers

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,640
another out of the box working way of styling your components and having scoped styling.

10
00:00:50,800 --> 00:01:00,580
Let's say for the user component, you add a style tag, style html element to your component jsx like

11
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,700
this

12
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:10,120
and then on that style, you set jsx as a prop, jsx is a prop

13
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:16,900
understood by style here because next use a special package which is called styled-jsx,

14
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:25,060
you can learn more about this on the github page of nextjs of course and styled-jsx is a package

15
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,850
which just allows you to write your css styles

16
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:31,810
here in your jsx code and then it will pull them out,

17
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:36,710
apply them to your component here and scope it to that component.

18
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:41,230
Again you can see how it works on the official github page of nextjs.

19
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,370
.

20
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,870
So here you can also use media queries and so on

21
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,530
and therefore, I could also write a div

22
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:54,930
here and style that. Important, you need to wrap all of that in curly braces and then two back ticks,

23
00:01:54,940 --> 00:02:00,760
now these are not single quotation marks but back ticks which allow you to create string literals in

24
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:06,910
javascript so basically multi-line strings you could say. Now in there, you can now style your div, like

25
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:07,500
that

26
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:18,910
and for example give it a border of 1px solid #eee, box-shadow of 0 2pxs 3px

27
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:27,310
#ccc and a padding of 20px and maybe also text align center.

28
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:33,620
Now with that, if we go back to the auth page, this is how our user now looks like.

29
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,940
So this is how we style components in nextjs,

30
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:45,300
we use this third party package, styled-jsx to create styles which are scoped to that given component.
