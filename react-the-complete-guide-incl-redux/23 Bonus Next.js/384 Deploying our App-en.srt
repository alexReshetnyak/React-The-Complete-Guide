1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:05,630
Over the last lectures we learned a lot about nextjs,

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,270
now there is more to learn about it

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:13,700
I will not doubt that. You can always visit the official github page I showed you a couple of times throughout

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:20,240
this module and you can visit learnnextjs.com, an official page by the creators of nextjs

5
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:27,400
which requires a github account to log in but which then step by step walks you through the core features.

6
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:32,390
With that, you should be able to really utilize this together with the react knowledge you gained throughout

7
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:36,820
this course because you are still building a react application in the end

8
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:42,230
to build a react that which is server side rendered by default where you don't need to worry about

9
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:47,810
code splitting and routing and where you therefore might have an easier time creating the react app

10
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,400
you're looking to create.

11
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,520
Let me finish this module by showing you how you actually prepared this for deployment then. Let's quit

12
00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:00,250
our development server and let's revisit the package.json file.

13
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,610
Remember we added three scripts here,

14
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:10,430
build and start are two other scripts. Build is the script you want to execute to build the project for deployment,

15
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:17,320
so by simply running npm run build, it will now compile and optimize all that code and spit it out,

16
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,070
ready for you to ship to a server.

17
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:24,120
Now once npm run build is done, you get the .next folder,

18
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,170
this now contains all the build content.

19
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:34,940
Now this folder here is what actually needs to be deployed but you would deploy the entire project folder

20
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,060
because you also need to install node modules and so on.

21
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:46,040
So you would deploy the entire project folder here to a host like AWS elastic beanstalk or Heroku.

22
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,700
And that's important,

23
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,900
you need a host, a service which is able to run nodeJS because nextjs

24
00:01:53,960 --> 00:02:01,820
uses nodejs and only works on nodejs, all the files you deploy are javascript files. So

25
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:02,620
you need a nodejs

26
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:10,700
ready host and then you ship your entire project there and just execute npm start, the third

27
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,360
script.

28
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,320
We can also run this locally since we got nodejs installed here.

29
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,110
this will now still serve the app on localhost:3000

30
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:25,130
but now it's the app we prepared for deployment, it works as before but it's actually using the optimized

31
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:31,430
files where everything is minified and so on and it shows that everything works and therefore

32
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:39,260
if you ship the entire project and then execute npm install followed by npm start on your server, you

33
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:46,370
have your react nextjs application running on a real server with all the benefits nextjs

34
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,480
gives you.

35
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,370
Again if you want to learn more about nextjs,

36
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:56,430
don't miss the chance of diving into the official docs here on the github repo or on learnnextjs.com

37
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,470
.
