00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:07,680
Welcome to this video. this is a video I also released on my YouTube channel, academind.

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,270
In this video, I will show you how to build this

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:15,840
burger we're building in the burger builder and with build the burger here, I mean not what we do in

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:21,780
the react app but I mean build the css code for the burger. We'll do this in codepen,

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,300
you can find the finished project attached to this video and I hope you'll like this,

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,650
I hope this was helpful and interesting to you

7
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:35,710
so have fun with the video.

8
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:42,990
So I want to build this burger here and it's written as I said entirely in css, we won't animate it,

9
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,690
we won't add javascript logic to build it up,

10
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:51,840
that is what we do with react in the react course but it is I guess interesting to see how you can use

11
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,720
css to create all these ingredients here.

12
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:01,680
So for that, let's create a new pen here on codepen which is the web editor I'm going to use, you

13
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,370
could build this locally

14
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:09,080
but here, this is a nice playing ground for exactly this kind of project so why don't we use it.

15
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:14,490
So in this new codepen here, I want to build the burger.

16
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:21,600
Now this burger as I said won't use javascript but it will use html and it will use css obviously

17
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,320
to well make the burger look like a burger. In html,

18
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,310
I will not have that many elements,

19
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,860
I will have a wrapping div which I will give to a class box and this will just be like a container for

20
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:40,480
the burger and then in there, I want to have a div for each ingredient

21
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:46,140
so the goal is to have something like bread-top maybe

22
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:54,530
and then also have something like salad and then bread-bottom it and we're going to add more ingredients

23
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:59,030
than just these three, this wouldn't be that delicious of a burger.

24
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:06,320
But that is the idea, having all these ingredients sit next to each other and styling them with css.

25
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:11,230
So this is our html code, how does the css code look like

26
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:17,720
that? Well I go, I'm going to create all these classes I'm using here and I'll start with the box which is

27
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,360
the most boring one because it's not an ingredient,

28
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:26,450
this box should just be the container for the burger and the burger then also should be built

29
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:30,850
in a way that it's really flexible and grows with the box.

30
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:38,240
So therefore to start off, I'll give this box a width of let's say 500px and the margin of auto to

31
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:45,160
just center it and a height of 450px and you can always adjust this later.

32
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:49,000
Now let's work on the bread-top

33
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:59,480
so this is the first element I got here on the left and now the bread-top should be a box with round

34
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,290
corners on the top left and right corner

35
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:09,200
so that we have a straight line at the bottom and clear edges on the sides, on the bottom edges but then on

36
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,280
the bottom corners

37
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:17,270
but then this rounded look at the top, like a burger bread you cut into pieces where you then, well take

38
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:20,240
the upper piece. In css,

39
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:27,350
we obviously always work with boxes and all these ingredients are nothing else than boxes with some

40
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,670
rounded edges, some round corners

41
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:30,980
from time to time.

42
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:37,310
So first of all, let's give this bread-top a height and let's say this should be 20%,

43
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:42,340
keep in mind, it's inside the box it will be 20% of that height here.

44
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:49,580
Let's also give it a width and let's say that should be 80% and we can always tweak this later,

45
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:57,260
now we want to have a background color for this bread-top so I'll assign background color and of course

46
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,680
you can make this red

47
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,610
so that we now see this box. Red

48
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:06,780
doesn't seem to be the most optimal color for bread though,

49
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:16,580
brown probably would be better but I actually want to use a linear gradient to give this also some three

50
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:22,870
dimensional look so that we don't have the same monotone color for the entire bread.

51
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:28,040
And if we want to use linear gradient, we can do this on background color because it's not treated as

52
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,710
a color,

53
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:31,360
we do it on the background property instead.

54
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:37,190
Now linear gradient takes all the different shapes you want to well, transition through and here I

55
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:40,820
only want to have two and I picked two brownish colors,

56
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:48,480
the first one the hash code for the, the hex code for the first one is #BC581E

57
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:57,550
and the second color I want to transition to is #E27B36, like this.

58
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,590
So this is the brown color I picked

59
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,160
and of course, you can always pick a different one.

60
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:06,110
Now here, we got the look

61
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:10,100
but of course we're missing the round corners and so on,

62
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:10,810
right

63
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:17,760
so we should probably add some border radius to this and now we could say 10px, this gives us

64
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,680
around corners everywhere.

65
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:24,420
We only want to have the top and the top two corners to be round though

66
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:32,210
so what we can do is we can say 10px 10px 0 0. The first two numbers or basically these numbers

67
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:35,870
go from top left to top right to bottom right to bottom left

68
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:44,480
so one time around the burger. If we do it like this, only the top corners around but 10px

69
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,030
isn't enough,

70
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:54,260
actually I'm going to use percentages here so we can use 50% here, 50% basically looks much

71
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,320
closer to a burger, a bread,

72
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,470
a cut up bread

73
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,770
look, as I want it.

74
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:05,930
Now in this, this bread almost already looks pretty good

75
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,730
but now I also want to give it some three dimensional look

76
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:17,090
so I'll add a box shadow but not one which goes outside of the bread but an inset shadow, so which falls

77
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:23,290
onto the bread so to say, then I'll use 15px

78
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:30,790
and 0 here as dimensions for this shadow and this black shadow actually doesn't look too bad

79
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:38,840
but I want to have some dark brown color here which I can get with #C15711 and this now looks

80
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,220
really good, for me at least

81
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,240
and as always, you can tweak this around.

82
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,970
Now with that we've got the bread-top finished for now,

83
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:50,280
now all these seeds on the bread are missing for now,

84
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,850
we'll add them later,

85
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:58,940
let's next work on the salad. Now how should the salad look like, how should the salad

86
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:01,020
be styled? For the salad,

87
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:06,430
let's first of all define its width and the bread-top had a width of 80%,

88
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:13,850
I think it would look nice if the salad is a little bit broader than the bread so maybe we take 90%

89
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,900
here,

90
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:20,120
we also have to assign a height and there, let's try 7%,

91
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:24,450
so much smaller than the bread because salad obviously isn't as big.

92
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:28,720
Now the next step is I want to give this a background color

93
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:34,700
and here again, I'm going to use a linear gradient to have this nicer look than just one single color

94
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:42,740
and there, I picked some green colors in advance #228C1D is the code of the first color,

95
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:50,620
the color where we're starting at and then I want to end at #91CE50.

96
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,830
This is now a green color,

97
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,830
it also is not positioned correctly.

98
00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:01,020
For one we want to use margin auto to center it,

99
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:07,450
the same should of course then be done on the bread on the top, here we also should center this.

100
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:14,830
Now it's centered but it also doesn't have any space between the bread and the salad

101
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:21,220
so we probably want to add some spacing, maybe 2% of the total height of the box to the bread

102
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:30,230
and maybe add the same amount of spacing to the salad and as so often, you can also finetune this of course.

103
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,850
So this is now the style I want to use,

104
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,370
one thing's missing,

105
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:45,380
I don't like the edges here, the corners of the salad, so it makes sense to give that a border radius of let's

106
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:50,560
say 20px and you can just play around with this number until it looks good to you,

107
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,220
I like this look, you can of course choose a different one.

108
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,620
So now we got the salad finished,

109
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,780
let's now work on the bottom

110
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,070
bread, so I'll add

111
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:06,680
bread-bottom here to target this last div

112
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:12,770
and on this bread, I'll also assign a height, let's bake 13%

113
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,160
so that's smaller than the top bread

114
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:20,100
but we also won't have this round part on the top here

115
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:25,390
and let's bake a width which probably should be equal to the width of the top bread

116
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:31,810
so 80% was our width there, let's go with the same width on the bottom bread.

117
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,410
Now so that we can see something,

118
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,040
I'll also use a background here

119
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:41,680
and I also want to set the background to a linear gradient here and I will use the following color,

120
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:49,150
#F08E4A and then go to #E27B36 and I simply picked

121
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:54,100
all these colors in some color pickers, before I started recording this.

122
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:57,360
Now we got the background color for that,

123
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:05,470
let's also add our margin of 2%, so to 2% and auto here to center this and have some spacing

124
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:11,850
and let's also add this inset box shadow as we use on the top bread

125
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:18,170
so inset -15px 0 and then #C15711

126
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,190
so that we get the same look as we have on the top.

127
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:29,000
Some border radius can't hurt here too though, a little bit too edgy for my taste

128
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:36,180
so I'll add a border radius but I won't use as round of a corner as we did for the top bread

129
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,380
instead the top two corners shouldn't be rounded,

130
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:47,000
also I'll assign a value of 0 but I want to have round corners at the bottom so I'll use 30px

131
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,460
here

132
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,460
and I like this

133
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,540
look, of course you can have

134
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:55,570
well make it a little bit less round with 20 maybe, also looks good,

135
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,820
whatever you like, I'll go back to 30

136
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:00,550
but again, you can tweak this to your needs

137
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,520
and with that, we get our bottom bread style too.

138
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:10,490
This already really looks nice in my opinion but we haven't gotten that many ingredients so time to add

139
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:11,510
more,

140
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:17,090
one great thing we can already see though is if I simply duplicate the salad div here,

141
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,200
well we got two salads in there

142
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,630
so that really works great,

143
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,150
it's reusable.

144
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:30,190
Still let's add more ingredients, let's add bacon below the salad, let's add cheese,

145
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:38,210
let's maybe start with two slices of cheese and let's add meat here, maybe also two slices.

146
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:42,280
These are all the ingredients I want to support and well, build here,

147
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,880
now let's add them step by step,

148
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,520
let's start with the bacon,

149
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:49,430
now I'm going to add this class right below the salad.

150
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:53,910
So the bacon also of course has to have a width

151
00:11:53,960 --> 00:12:00,880
and here I'll use 80% to have it as width as the bread, you can make it smaller, you can make

152
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:08,950
it bigger, whatever you want, the height should be really small because bacon isn't that fat, at least

153
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:11,620
not from the height perspective

154
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,790
and we also want to assign a background here

155
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:20,800
and as always, I'll use a linear gradient here too to have nicer colors. The linear gradient here should

156
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:35,440
go from #BF3813 to #C45E38, like that and let's also add our margin of 2% and auto,

157
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,590
to center it,

158
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,850
that's my bacon.

159
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:45,730
Now here, I don't actually have round corners, you could add them, you could add rounded corners here but

160
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:52,150
I like my bacon to have rough edges, rough corners like it has here, again as always change this if you

161
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,630
want a different look.

162
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,990
Let me move on to the cheese

163
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:59,780
and you probably already understood the pattern,

164
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:06,220
we can copy the code from the bacon here and just adjust these values. For example,

165
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:12,240
I want to have cheese which overlaps or which goes beyond the width of my bread,

166
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:16,430
so I'll pick let's say 91%

167
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:25,380
here, the height of the cheese could be 3% but let's make it slightly bigger, maybe 4.5

168
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:28,140
and the color of course is off,

169
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,700
it should be in a yellowish region,

170
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:37,440
so there I'll pick #F4D004 and then

171
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:42,920
#D6BB22 and obviously, I know all these hex codes by heart,

172
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:46,810
no you simply look them up and pick a color you like,

173
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:49,290
so that's our background.

174
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:52,050
Now for the cheese, I want to have round corners again

175
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:58,840
so I'll add a border radius here and I'll simply set 20px for all corners,

176
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,270
this looks nice to me

177
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,640
looks like nice cheese,

178
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,370
as always you can

179
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,000
tweak it

180
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:09,040
but I like the look of these cheese pieces here and that already is the cheese.

181
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:12,770
Now of course that's not all though, we also get the meat, so I'll

182
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:18,110
duplicate the cheese because meat also will need width and height and so on

183
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:22,040
so let me name this meat here.

184
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:29,130
Now let's think about the width, I'll go with maybe 78%, slightly smaller than the bread,

185
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:37,210
I'll give it a height of let's say 8% to have bigger slices of meat,

186
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,970
the background here again will be a linear gradient

187
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:53,600
and here I want to go from #7F3608 to #702E05 for this look of my bread.

188
00:14:53,820 --> 00:15:02,160
The border radius may be a little bit less round, maybe 15px, looks nice to me and I think the width

189
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,870
should be a little big or maybe 82%,

190
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:06,430
yeah that looks better

191
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:12,120
and with that, I'm I'm happy with the look of my of my meat, it looks good to me,

192
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,080
I got my meat here,

193
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:14,890
looks fine.

194
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:22,290
So as you can see, we basically have a lot of similar properties in all these ingredients, we just assign

195
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,080
different values for them

196
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:30,400
but besides that, all ingredients work in the same way. What we can also already see is if I go up to

197
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:36,780
my box and I decrease this to 300px, it all adjusts, of course the burger can look a bit

198
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:40,440
skewed depending on how you set the aspect ratio here

199
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:45,450
but in general, it adjusts nicely so that is really good,

200
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,910
I'll go back to what I used before though.

201
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:55,470
Now this is the burger in general but the seeds on the top bread are missing and the seeds are actually

202
00:15:55,470 --> 00:16:01,510
a bit more work to to have them look good. So the seeds will be wrapped

203
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:09,930
elements in this bread-top div, I'll add a seeds element and a seeds to elements, so two divs with these

204
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:12,090
two different classes.

205
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:19,020
Now the reason for this is that I of course want to have more than one seed and I will take advantage

206
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:26,910
of a css feature to actually convert each div here into up to three seeds if I want to but I can't

207
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:30,170
go above these three seeds easily.

208
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,570
So I'll use this approach and here,

209
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,900
how do we make this work?

210
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:44,060
I will add my seeds class here below bread-top to start working with that,

211
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:53,950
I want to position it inside the bread-top and I want to be able to use this like an absolute viewport.

212
00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:04,150
So I want to use position absolute here to really display or position these seeds as I want, now for

213
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:08,130
absolute, referring to my outer div,

214
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:13,140
I need to give my bread-top class the position relative,

215
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,550
then the next absolute position will refer to this.

216
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:23,890
Now we can start working on the seeds, I'll give them a width of 10% and this will now refer to the width

217
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:33,740
of the bread-top not to the box width and I'll give my seed, let's say our height of 15%,

218
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:40,430
now I also need to give them some color and here I'll simply use white as a background color.

219
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:45,720
With that we don't see the seed yet because I also need to position it,

220
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,260
I do this with left and top.

221
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:53,050
Now I'll try left 30% and top 50%

222
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:59,570
and now we see the seeds appear here, 30% into the burger and 50% from the top.

223
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,320
Now of course my seed also should have round corners,

224
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:12,390
so I'll give it a border radius of 40% to not have an entire ellipse but some edges but overall,

225
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,700
very round corners.

226
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,160
Now the next thing is I want to rotate it a little bit,

227
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:25,740
so I'll use the transform property and then rotate the rotate function and let's say by -20 degrees

228
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:31,730
so that it's not sitting parallel and parallel on the burger.

229
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:38,700
And finally I'll also give it a box shadow, an inset shadow -2px -3px and then

230
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:43,290
let's say #C9C9C9 which is like a grayish shadow,

231
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:49,560
I like this look here and you can always tweak these values to reposition the shadow.

232
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,740
So that's my first seed but I want to have more than one

233
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:56,420
and now I'm going to use a little well trick, well not really a trick,

234
00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:03,620
I'm using a pseudo selector and taking the seeds class I just worked on and I'll add the after pseudo selector,

235
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:12,450
this allows me to create a new element which is displayed after this seed element, the content should

236
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:13,630
be an empty string,

237
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:19,890
this is required to display something though and then I'll give it a width of 100% because this

238
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:22,740
will now refer to the seeds class,

239
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:29,670
so to this width, so not 100% of the bread-top but 100% of the width of this seed and it

240
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:34,400
should be equally sized, therefore 100%. Now height

241
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:42,890
will be 100% so I'll add it like this and now, let's also give this a position of

242
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:44,300
absolute,

243
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:51,030
let's give it a background color of white and let's give it a left position

244
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,540
and now this also refers to the other seed

245
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,490
so I'll use -170% to move it to the left,

246
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:02,900
100% of, 70% of the width of that previous seed

247
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:08,230
and let's move it to the top by -260%,

248
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:14,260
this will move up by 2.6 times the height of this seed.

249
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:22,790
Now all I need to do is give this the round corners we already used, so 40% and I want to rotate

250
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,130
this differently,

251
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,250
so now I'll transform this

252
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:35,300
and if I now do rotate 0 degrees, it won't change because now the default rotation is the rotation of the

253
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:35,710
element

254
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,000
I positioned it after,

255
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,530
so of these seeds.

256
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:46,430
So now if I wanted to make this, well convert this back to be in parallel to my bread-top, I would have

257
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:53,720
to rotate it by 20 degrees, so if I do that it's back to a straight element, a straight line.

258
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,520
I want to rotate it by 60 degrees though

259
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:00,550
so to have it rotate in the opposite direction essentially.

260
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:05,550
And then I'm going to add a box shadow here

261
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:15,290
also with inset 1px 2px and then #C9C9C9, like this,

262
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:19,190
so this is the second seed I wanted to add.

263
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,540
Now I'll add a third one

264
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:29,570
and for that, I'm going to copy the seeds after element here, paste it in and change after to the other

265
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,880
pseudo selector before.

266
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:37,310
Now I can also do the same and create another seed visually,

267
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,650
so all the set up here is the same,

268
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:43,120
the position changes though, I want to move this to the right

269
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:51,600
so let's use 180% and then I want to not push this up as high so I'll use

270
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,610
-50% to move it up.

271
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:58,270
Then all the rest however stays the same,

272
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:04,200
I'll just adjust the box shadow to come from an opposite direction with -3px,

273
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,230
now it's coming from the bottom, whoops from the bottom left

274
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:13,110
and with that, that seed also looks good to me.

275
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:21,930
Now we can work on the next seed, seedsTwo because I only have after and before, so I'll need my new element

276
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:32,080
seedsTwo and seedsTwo of course just is styled as the other seed, without a pseudo selector was.

277
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:38,450
So I'm going to copy the code from there and paste it into seedsTwo, like this

278
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:42,140
and now let's see what we have to adjust, position absolute, width and height,

279
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,380
that's all great,

280
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,920
the positioning here has to change,

281
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:53,940
I'm going to push this farther to the right with a distance to the left of 64% and I'll

282
00:22:53,990 --> 00:23:00,590
leave top to 50%, set to 50% though. I'll leave the border radius but I want to rotate

283
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:07,820
it differently, let's say +10 degree to have a slight rotation to the right and adjust the box shadow

284
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:11,060
-3px then maybe zero

285
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,480
and the same color as before.

286
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:16,460
Now with that, we got this seed in place,

287
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,070
now I'll use seeds after again.

288
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:24,690
So let me copy seedsTwo here,

289
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:33,160
use the after pseudo selector with as you learned, as height should be 100%.

290
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:35,010
Now the position has to change though,

291
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:39,780
first of all, let me add some content however so that we can see something

292
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,650
and now let's move farther to the right,

293
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:51,620
maybe by pushing this 150% to, well to the right away from left and for top, let me use

294
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:55,280
-130% to move it up a little bit.

295
00:23:55,340 --> 00:24:01,490
Border radius is fine but let me rotate it by 90 degree to really have it be rotated totally different

296
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:11,300
and I'll adjust the shadow to use 1px 3px here, to come from the right like this.

297
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:17,540
Now with that, I got this seed in place and I'd say this looks like a nice burger.

298
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:24,950
This is the burger we built in the react app in the burger builder in this react course and I hope

299
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:30,460
you enjoyed learning how you can build elements like this with just css,

300
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:34,100
this doesn't use svg, doesn't use any images,

301
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:41,550
nothing like that, it's just css and as you saw, not even that many css properties we're using.

302
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,390
So really, I hope you like this kind of video,

303
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:49,340
I hope this was helpful and hopefully see you in future videos too.

304
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,940
You can of course find this code attached to this video. Bye.
