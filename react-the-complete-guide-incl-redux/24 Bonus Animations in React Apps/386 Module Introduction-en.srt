Welcome to this module, in this module we'll have a look at animation in the react apps.

2
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:15,320
We actually already do use some animations, some tiny animations in our course project in the burger

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,060
builder,

4
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:22,280
think about this order now button which bumps up when it becomes active but we're not doing much with

5
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:28,890
animations and there would be some things we just couldn't do or at least couldn't do in a nice way.

6
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,120
I'll dive into these things in this module.

7
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:37,790
So the overall goal of this module is to show you which different ways or options you have when it comes

8
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:42,140
to animating react apps because animations are important,

9
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:49,670
they're not just something to consider in apps, animations instead are something you might need in almost

10
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,210
any app because animations guide user attention,

11
00:00:53,210 --> 00:01:00,240
they show the user what changed, they make it nicer to the eye and they are therefore an important concept.

12
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,570
So with that let's dive into the different ways of animating react apps we can think off.
