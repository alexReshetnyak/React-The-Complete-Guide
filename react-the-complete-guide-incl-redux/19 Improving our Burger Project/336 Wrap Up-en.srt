1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:08,380
So with lazy loading added, we finished the optimization of our project. Feel free to do more, to organize

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:13,400
your folders differently or outsource more functions into a helper functions.

3
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:20,020
I think we have a nicely optimized well working application which looks good, which behaves exactly as

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,080
it should behave,

5
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:27,790
also on mobile devices and which allows us to really present a pleasant user experience to the user

6
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,300
and use a lot of the features react gives us.

7
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,490
Now in the next modules, we'll fine tune this application to be ready for deployment,

8
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:41,920
with that I actually mostly mean I'll show you how you could test the application automatically.

9
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,610
Then we will deploy it and then we will have a totally finished react application.

10
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,650
So let's move on.
