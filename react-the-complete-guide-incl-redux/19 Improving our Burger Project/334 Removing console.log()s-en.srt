1
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,730
So a lot has been optimized in our application already

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:09,790
and as I said before, you might find more potential of course.

3
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:13,440
Now let's turn our heads towards our terminal output here,

4
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:18,850
we haven't got many warnings but there is one, that in the checkout.js file in our containers

5
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:22,820
folder, that there is an import which we never use.

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,310
Let's have a look,

7
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:25,680
checkout container,

8
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,390
there we import actions

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,920
and indeed in this file, we never dispatch any actions so we may simply get rid of that.

10
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,880
And that's in general an important thing,

11
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,550
have a look at your console output, it shouldn't show any warnings,

12
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:45,820
remove unnecessary imports to prevent bloating your final bundle size

13
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:49,310
and speaking of console output, this one is clean now

14
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:54,490
but if we have a look at the console of our running application we notice that we have a lot of console

15
00:00:54,490 --> 00:01:00,620
log statements, in the modal, in the burger, in the burger builder, probably somewhere else.

16
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:06,400
It is also a good idea to clean up your application not because these console log statements would

17
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,590
be that bad but they will be there in production too and they will give insights into your application

18
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:17,770
and besides that, you don't really need to spam the console with output that doesn't matter to you anymore.

19
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:21,460
So let's visit these three files here to begin with cleaning up,

20
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,280
I'll have a look at the burger.js

21
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:29,360
file in the components folder and find the console log statement there,

22
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:32,140
here where we output props, let's remove that.

23
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:39,520
Another one can be found if we go to burger builder, in burger builder files in the burger builder

24
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:47,530
container, lets visit this file too and let's have a look at where we use console log here in

25
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:47,960
componentDidMount,

26
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,990
let's also remove that and the other one was in the modal

27
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:57,370
so let's also visit that in the UI folder, in the components folder, there we log in the componentWillUpdate

28
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:02,770
and I can remove this entire block since we don't do anything else there. We did this in the past

29
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,880
to get some insights when this gets fired,

30
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:11,260
it's not interesting to us anymore. You see we also do some logging in orderSummary when we add and remove

31
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,320
ingredients,

32
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:20,230
so let's visit the orderSummary too, we can find that in the burger part of our components, there

33
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:24,460
we have the order summary component and in there, if we have a look,

34
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:30,110
we find the console log statement in componentWillUpdate so we can remove this too.

35
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:37,330
And with that, we could also convert this again into a functional component because all we do is just

36
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:42,670
render something. Now I'll leave it a class based one here but you could easily convert this to optimize this

37
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:47,530
even further. With that let's see, where else do we get console log statements,

38
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:56,160
let's continue and let's quickly sign ourselves in, switch to sign in so we get output here in auth.js,

39
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,100
that is our action creator file.

40
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,740
Let's see if we get some output somewhere else,

41
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:11,090
if I just entering some arbitrary values here in the order field and I click order, then we also get

42
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,150
one from the order actions file,

43
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:20,700
so let's visit these files too in in the actions folder, auth.js had a console log statement,

44
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,630
so let's get rid of that and let's get rid of the console log statement in the order file in the same folder,

45
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:27,360
there

46
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,440
console log,

47
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:36,370
let's remove that too. Now we might have more console log statements somewhere in our application but I

48
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:40,280
think I removed most of them, feel free to remove any other. Again,

49
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,160
certainly not that harmful if you leave them in there

50
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,990
but it's better if you get rid of them.
