00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,170
Welcome to this module.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,000
This is kind of a special module,

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:14,110
I just want to walk over our burger builder application and analyze it, fix some tiny glitches it has

4
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,680
and see what we can improve about it.

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:22,970
Well probably you'll find even more you can improve about it because which application is ever finished.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,660
But I want to have a polished project after this module which works and feels nice,

7
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:32,470
it already does so but there are some things we can improve.

8
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:38,110
So let's dive right into that and let's start by fixing a little issue in the next lecture.
