1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,680
So let's implement this

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:11,210
checkout component. I'll actually implement it in a container because it will be a component which

3
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:16,590
manages its own state and also passes this down to other components.

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,690
So add a new folder in containers and I'll name it checkout and in there I'll add that checkout.js

5
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:27,010
file which well should hold my checkout component.

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:34,190
It'll be a class based component and state will be involved and therefore I extend the component object

7
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:42,380
which I have to import from react together with the react package itself to support jsx.

8
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,610
So let's add this class,

9
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:53,720
let's then export it as a default of this file and then let's plan how does it checkout component should

10
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:56,000
look like and should behave.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,970
What I want to have in the checkout component is a tiny summary of the checkout

12
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:10,290
so basically what the user is about to buy and the price probably and then a button to cancel the checkout

13
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:15,460
process and go back to the burger builder and of course a button to continue.

14
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:22,580
And I guess for the summary, it would be nice to not again show just a list of the ingredients but maybe

15
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,210
show the burger itself,

16
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,060
rebuild the burger in this

17
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,850
checkout summary.

18
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,760
So that's the goal here, show this summary

19
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:36,700
and then when the user clicks on continue I then want to load the contact form.

20
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:44,780
So step by step, the goal therefore is to create a checkout summary form which allows me to display a

21
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:52,280
preview of the burger and show the continue or cancel buttons. For that I'll go into my components folder

22
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:55,340
and add a new folder in there

23
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,530
which I'll name

24
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:05,770
checkout or maybe order to replace all order related components there like the checkout component, check

25
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:05,960
out

26
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,740
it should be named

27
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,980
checkout summary maybe.

28
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,270
And then there I'll create a checkoutsummary

29
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:14,840
.js file and a

30
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:20,310
checkout summary css file for the styling.

31
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:27,440
Now let's have a look at the checkoutsummary.js file, there I'll use the functional form to

32
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,950
create the checkout summary component

33
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:33,580
so basically just checkout summary function here as you know it.

34
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:39,630
We will probably receive some props to render the burger and then return some jsx

35
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,810
so therefore we definitely need to import react from the react package

36
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,260
and of course as always, export

37
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:50,150
checkout summary as the default.

38
00:02:50,150 --> 00:03:00,180
Now the goal is to display a preview of our burger here and then show continue or cancel buttons.

39
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:09,500
So what I'll do is in the jsx which I want to return here, I'll first of all wrap this in a div which

40
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:14,900
I'll also use for styling purposes to give this component some style,

41
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:19,640
then I want to have a h1 tag where I say we hope it tastes well,

42
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,940
something like that and thereafter,

43
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:29,420
now I want to have a box, a div basically, where I want to preview my burger component.

44
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,650
This div is required to set the boundaries of that burger component.

45
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:37,240
and of course I'm going to reuse my burger component which I already have,

46
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,180
that's the cool thing,

47
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:45,590
we can reuse it. So I'll set some inline styling here on that wrapping div which will hold my burger

48
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:55,420
just to set the width of let's say 300px and then also our height of let's say 300px and let's

49
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:00,180
then also set the margin to auto here.

50
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:06,970
Now inside that div I want to use my burger component, I'll import it. I'll import burger from and

51
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:11,620
now navigate up into the burger folder and there is the burger.js file,

52
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:15,730
this is our burger component which I can now conveniently add like this,

53
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,790
the burger, a self-closing tag.

54
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:24,050
I there also need to pass my ingredients and for that

55
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:29,740
it will of course be important to know how I receive these ingredients.

56
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:37,220
I assume that for now I can simply just set the ingredients property of my burger component which it

57
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,080
does expect if we have a look at the burger component,

58
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:47,060
we have props ingredients in there which we use so I should also pass this to this ingredient, to this

59
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,380
component

60
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,670
Oops not ordersummary, checkoutsummary,

61
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:51,630
here we are.

62
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:58,460
So we expect the ingredients in the burger so we should pass it and for now I'll just expect that in the

63
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,970
checkout summary component,

64
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:08,450
I'll also get ingredients property which I then just pass on. Below that I then want to show my buttons

65
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:16,160
and for that, i'll import my own buttons I built. So the button component from the UI folder and there

66
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:24,130
from the button folder and then the button.js file of course and these buttons as you probably know support

67
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,640
two different styles,

68
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:31,850
we have the success and the danger class here which we can pass and we do pass it with the button type

69
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,200
property.

70
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,900
So I'll add my buttons below

71
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,210
there, I'll add the first button

72
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,890
where I'll set the button type to

73
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:48,260
let's say Danger with a capital D because that's the css class name where I is simply want to say CANCEL,

74
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:55,850
maybe all caps for styling purposes only and then I'll duplicate it to also have a Success button with

75
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:00,210
a capital S where I will say CONTINUE.

76
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,800
So these are the two buttons,

77
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:08,510
you also know that the buttons expose the click property which simply indicates that we clicked on the

78
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,910
button, so that is something I'll also need to do,

79
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,210
let's split this over multiple lines,

80
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,460
implement click here and then do something upon a click.

81
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,810
Now that is something I will add, for now I just want to finish the styling of this component.

82
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:29,970
So with that we got our checkout summary jsx code,

83
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:36,820
now let me also assign a class name to the wrapping div and this is a class I want to set up in check

84
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:42,900
outsummary.css file. I'll add the checkoutsummary css class here

85
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:50,290
because remember we're back in our course project, we're using css modules here to scope our styles.

86
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:57,080
There I'll set text align to center to center everything, I'll set the width to 80% maybe and

87
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,440
a margin of auto to then center this div or this element

88
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:08,300
and I'll add a media query where I'll check if we have a minimum width of 600px at which point of time

89
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:13,110
I simply want to limit the width so that it's no longer a percent

90
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,730
but here I will limit it to 500px

91
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:24,560
Now with that I have to import this css code or the classes object you should be precise, from

92
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,860
checkoutsummary.css and then assign it here.

93
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,500
So here I'll add classes

94
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,050
checkout summary

95
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,190
taking advantage of css modules here.

96
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:38,280
Now we get to checkoutsummary component,

97
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:46,640
I now want to use that in my checkout file, in my checkout container to be precise. So there, I'll quickly

98
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:54,170
import that checkoutsummary component we just created from the components folder

99
00:07:54,170 --> 00:08:01,050
therefore, there I created that order folder which hold the checkout summary folder and there, the check

100
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,690
outsummary.js file.

101
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:11,070
Now inside my checkout component where I'll implement a render method where I then of course return

102
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:17,270
some jsx, there I want to have a div which wraps my entire page because this will be used as a page with

103
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:21,940
the react router of course and in there, I'll now add

104
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,340
checkoutsummary like this.

105
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:25,250
Keep in mind,

106
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:32,630
checkoutsummary expects to get ingredients as a prop so I should pass ingredients here and that of

107
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,860
course is an interesting question,

108
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,560
where do I get my ingredients from?

109
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:46,290
For now, I'll simply pass a dummy ingredients object but of course this is something I will replace.

110
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:54,210
I will add state to the checkout component and there in the state, I'll add ingredients and ingredients

111
00:08:54,220 --> 00:09:01,700
for now will be salad one, meat one, cheese one and bacon one

112
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,430
and this again is just some dummy data which I'll replace.

113
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:12,330
So for now that allows me to pass this.state.ingredients, we will have to use routing to really pass ingredients

114
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,830
later.

115
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,930
Now we get the checkoutsummary and checkout container here,

116
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:26,170
I now want to use it of course and for that, I will hardcode it into my app.js file right below the

117
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,540
burger builder.

118
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:38,260
Here I'll import the checkout container from ./Containers/Checkout/Checkout just to see how

119
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,220
it looks.

120
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:42,700
We will load and wire routing soon,

121
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:49,630
make sure to save all files and make sure npm start is running and thereafter, if you visit your page,

122
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:54,500
We get an error regarding the onclick listener but that shouldn't be a problem right now.

123
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,960
This is how it looks like our

124
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,360
checkoutsummary component.

125
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:05,470
Now we can see that somehow the state of the burger is not really centered so this is something we

126
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,670
should fix.

127
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:11,890
For that, I'll go back into the checkoutsummary where I used the burger and one thing I should adjust here

128
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:18,070
is that I should use width 100% to take the full width of the checkout summary component.

129
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:25,080
Now with that that looks much better on both small devices and bigger devices. Now on small devices

130
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:29,050
here, we got a little bit much height,

131
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:32,020
this is something we can fix by disabling this height,

132
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,630
to not always setting it to 300px.

133
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,990
So let's just get rid of the height property here too,

134
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,970
for the styling that was a little bit too much.

135
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:47,020
Now we can definitely use that on mobile devices and on the desktop,

136
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:47,870
this looks good

137
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:55,620
too. Now of course there is still some space but we need some space for bigger burgers so this is deliberate

138
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:02,830
but the main thing I now want to work on is that I don't always display this but instead this should

139
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,770
be displayed.

140
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:12,130
If I click on order now, continue then I want to load to checkoutsummary instead of the burger builder,

141
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:15,430
that's the goal and for that of course we need routing.

142
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:22,510
Now feel free to go ahead and implement this on your own and then compare your solution with mine which

143
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,790
I'll start building in the next lecture.
