1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:08,010
So we can visit the checkout page, on the checkout page let's make the buttons which are part of

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:13,190
CheckoutSummary work,the cancel and continue button.

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,460
Now these buttons are of course in the CheckoutSummary, I could handle them there by turning it into

4
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:27,870
a class but I just want to expose this event basically in a checkout container which wraps the

5
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:34,240
CheckoutSummary component by using this good old approach of using props and then any props I expect to get

6
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,930
the reference to the method which should be executed upon a click at.

7
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,860
So here I will name is

8
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:50,600
onCheckoutCancelled or just CheckoutCancelled to be in line with my previous namings and then here,

9
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,650
propsCheckoutContinued.

10
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,340
Now I need to implement these props when using the CheckoutSummary component

11
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:05,350
so there I don't only pass ingredients, I also have CheckoutCancelled and I have CheckoutContinued.

12
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,680
Now I need methods which do something upon each of the two, I'll add a

13
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:17,850
checkoutCancelledHandler which is a method which should do something and I'll use this method syntax

14
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:26,070
to be able to use the this keyword inside of there and checkoutContinuedHandler which should also

15
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,130
look like that.

16
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:35,310
Now since I'm in the checkout container which was loaded with the route component, we here also have

17
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:42,390
access to this props and there too, the history prop, and the history prop also has a go back method

18
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,990
which I want to execute upon cancelling.

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,440
This simply goes back to the last page, in the other case here where I want to continue, I'll use replace

20
00:01:52,440 --> 00:02:02,690
instead to replace the current route with checkout/contactData for example. We don't handle this

21
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:10,010
path yet but this should be the path which soon loads the contactData component which we don't have

22
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:11,390
yet again.

23
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:15,230
Now we need to hook these handlers up so down there,

24
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:20,690
This CheckoutCancelledHandler and does checkoutContinuedHandler should be used,

25
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:24,190
save all the files and now let's try this out on

26
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:29,140
checkout. If I click on cancel and take it back to my burger builder

27
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,430
let me go back to checking out, if I click Continue,

28
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:39,910
You'll see URL changes but of course that doesn't do anything because we're not handling it yet

29
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:43,590
so this is something I will have to handle in the future.

30
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:50,390
The thing I want to do before handling that though is that I want to render the burger I really built

31
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:55,010
and not some arbitrary burger here. To render the burger

32
00:02:55,010 --> 00:03:04,010
I actually built, I will have to pass the respective data about my burger to the checkout page.

33
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:11,030
So from the burger builder here. There I build some burger and if I now click order now and continue,

34
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:19,100
I need to pass data about ingredients onto the checkout page. This is the next goal, pass the data on

35
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:25,960
I want to pass it on while a query parent is here. Again feel free to implement this on your own,

36
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:31,380
you learned everything you need for this over the last module, we'll do it together in the next lecture.
