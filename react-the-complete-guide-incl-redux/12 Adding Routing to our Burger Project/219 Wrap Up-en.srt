1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,580
So again we achieved a lot over the last lectures.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,570
We have our orders page finished,

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:14,910
We have our burger builder which is really working great, which leads us forward to the checkout page

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:21,030
where we load the checkout form, the form here isn't finished but we can issue an order, we are redirected

5
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,390
thereafter and we can see that order here,

6
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,200
so that is all working fine.

7
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,460
Now things we can improve are that

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,240
Checkout form which I just mentioned, this one here

9
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:40,800
and of course in general the state management of our application. We can already see that we have to

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,650
use some tricks and workarounds from time to time, that is something we'll improve throughout this course once

11
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,540
we dive into redux

12
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:55,530
though. Still we have a nicely working application which already is way more than just a tiny little

13
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,010
side project.

14
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,770
Awesome work thus far,

15
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,490
let's now I'm deeper into forms and then additional features

16
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,240
The react ecosystem offers to us.
