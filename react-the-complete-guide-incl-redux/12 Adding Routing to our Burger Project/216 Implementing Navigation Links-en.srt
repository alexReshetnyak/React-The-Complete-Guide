1
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:09,610
Let's touch our navigation items and adjust them to our new world in which we are now with routing.

2
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:17,240
So in that navigation items here, here we have our links, our navigation item components where we

3
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,120
pass the link.

4
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,910
Now here I already want to adjust something,

5
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:26,780
we have the burger builder and the path and it should be slash

6
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:34,850
but the second item should lead to /orders and actually have a caption of orders too. Now inside

7
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:40,840
the navigation item, we also have to adjust something because right now we're using a normal anchor tag.

8
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:45,380
Now as you learned when using routing I don't really want to do that,

9
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:52,210
instead I want to use the link provided by the react router.

10
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,360
So from react-router-dom, that's the package

11
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:03,530
but now I don't want to use the normal link component, I'll use nav link because I want to style the active

12
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:10,520
link and actually I want to use the default of having a css class named active because that's the

13
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,460
css class

14
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,610
I have defined in my css file too.

15
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:20,990
If you chose a different class name here, you will have to adjust the class name which is assigned by a nav

16
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,870
link as shown in the routing module.

17
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:33,250
Now with nav link imported, I want to use it instead of the anchor tag, ref therefore becomes two and

18
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,480
the class name isn't needed at all,

19
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,100
we don't have to define if it's active or not,

20
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:41,320
it will automatically determine this.

21
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,590
Now here the closing tag of course all that should be nav link.

22
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:50,680
Now since we no longer need to pass the information whether that's active or not, I can go back to the

23
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,510
navigation item and I no longer need to set this active prop here

24
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,900
so let's get rid of that too.

25
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:02,040
Now let's save all files and go back to our application

26
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:09,550
and as you see, we see the updated navigation items but we don't see an active item.

27
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:14,760
Now let's hover over this item and you'll see that it has the active class,

28
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,330
do you know why it's not working?

29
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:24,180
This is tricky to spot, but it makes perfect sense that we don't see this class having any effect.

30
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,220
It is related to css modules,

31
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:36,040
keep in mind the nav link automatically appends or attaches a class named active.

32
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,600
And of course, we set up the active class here, a navigation item css

33
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:50,700
but keep in mind that css modules will actually take our class names here and convert them into unique

34
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,630
class names.

35
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:58,010
Therefore when we set up active here in css, it won't come out as active,

36
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,560
it will have some hash attached to it,

37
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,350
it will be unique.

38
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:10,080
Therefore active class attached at runtime by nav link will not match our active class.

39
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:18,420
We can easily fix that though, that nav link element has one extra property we can set up,

40
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,300
we can set our own active class name as you learned.

41
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,240
You can add active class name here, and here

42
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:34,450
I then want to use classes, active again referring to my classes object which comes from my css file,

43
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:41,840
this will now be the active class name as our css modules transformation spits it out.

44
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:48,000
Now with that, if we save this you already see it's now active because actually the class name is Navigation

45
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:55,630
Item__active__some hash, this is our unique class name. We can

46
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,480
also click on orders now

47
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,530
and you see we are on orders,

48
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:04,840
it is active but the first link also is still active.

49
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,880
Now you probably can fix this,

50
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,730
definitely go ahead and do so

51
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,660
and otherwise I will show you my fix to this in a second.

52
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:20,530
This of course is also active due to the way this nav link interprets the active route.

53
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:27,350
Keep in mind that the to path here is what determines whether this is the active route or not and it's

54
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,460
treated as a prefix as learned.

55
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:36,310
So as long as our current paths starts with this path here, this link is treated to be active.

56
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:40,120
And for just slash every route starts with that.

57
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,990
So we can simply fix this by adding the exact route here

58
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:48,530
and with that we make sure that this only gets used if it is exact.

59
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:52,290
Now of course will attach exact to all nav links,

60
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:58,640
If you only knew that somewhere this should happen, you could simply pass the exact property, a new property

61
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:05,900
i just defined to navigation item and in navigation item, you can now bind the exact prop of nav link

62
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,490
to props exact, so to the one you're passing in from outside.

63
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:17,170
Now this will actually only be used on the first link with just slash and not on the second with orders.

64
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:22,910
The result still is the same burger builder is only active if we are on the burger builder, if we are

65
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,980
on orders, then the orders are active.

66
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,330
Now this is how we implement the links.

67
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:33,400
Now let's make sure that we actually fetched the orders from the server.
