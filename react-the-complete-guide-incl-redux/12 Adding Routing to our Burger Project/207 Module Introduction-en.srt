00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,200
Back we are in our burger project,

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:12,460
time to add some routing to it and use the things we learned in the last course module in a real react

3
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,150
application.

4
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:20,560
Now definitely feel free to jump ahead from time to time, puase the video and implement some feature

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,580
I'm about to show you to practice using the router.

6
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:32,760
I want to start by adding a page which allows us to actually check our burger out. Right now, checkout

7
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,550
looks like this,

8
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:39,700
we add an ingredient, we click order now we click continue and then we already send a request to the

9
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,890
backend to submit that burger and to save it there.

10
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:50,980
Now I'd like to change this so that I have to actually enter some information in a checkout form

11
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,000
before we really save the burger.

12
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:59,130
So this should be the first other page I want to have, a checkout page.

13
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:05,630
I also have a link here at the top which might allow us to navigate there, though we'll probably replace

14
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:10,620
this throughout this module with my orders page because that makes more sense.

15
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:16,840
But let's start with the checkout component and let's start with building that in the next lecture.

16
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,610
Definitely feel free to jump ahead and build it on your own but also feel free to do it together with

17
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:27,520
me because obviously there are a lot of different ways of creating checkout component and creating

18
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,330
the component itself is a nice practice but not really related to routing.

19
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,700
See you in the next lecture.
