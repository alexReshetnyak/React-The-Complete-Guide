1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:08,730
Let's work on the my orders page and for that, I'll create a new folder into containers folder, i'll name

2
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:13,610
it orders and in there, I will obviously create orders.js

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:20,490
file which is the container for the orders. This will be created with the class keyword, class

4
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:29,360
Order extends component is the code I want to write there and in there I'll import react and component

5
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,480
to be able to create a component

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,850
in this way and then i'll export this class, this order class, orders

7
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:44,690
class excuse me, orders class as the default. Now in there, we obviously will have a render method where we

8
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:48,870
return the jsx for this component.

9
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:55,070
The question of course is what do we want to render in there? I want to output my orders in this

10
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,040
page obviously.

11
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:03,400
For that I'll create a new component in the order component folder, the order component itself, order.js

12
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:11,840
and order.css, and now the question of course is how should a single order look like in this

13
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,920
page.

14
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:20,720
Well I will create it as a function, I will receive props and I will return some jsx.

15
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:28,850
Obviously as always, we import react from react here and we export these function as the file default.

16
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:36,530
With that, our order should be a div which will receive some styling in the end of course and I simply want

17
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,120
to output the ingredients and the price here

18
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:49,790
let's say. So I want to have something like a paragraph here in that paragraph, I could say

19
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,490
ingredients:

20
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:57,600
and then here I have the ingredients like salad and that in parentheses, thereafter the amount like

21
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,340
1 or something like that,

22
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:08,540
and then I might have something like the price always in a paragraph and in strong tags to emphasize it

23
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:18,500
then the value like $5.45. This is how one order should look like and of course the ingredients

24
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,990
and the price of something I will need to receive

25
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:25,090
via props, so I need some styling though.

26
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,540
I'll create an order.css class the order.css file, our

27
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:33,640
Orders should span the full width let's say

28
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:42,860
so width 100%, I want to have a border of 1px solid in this gray color and I'll add a box-

29
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:52,240
shadow of 0 2px 3px and this gray color change the border color to a slightly brighter one.

30
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,590
I'll add some padding 10px, I'll add a margin

31
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:06,330
let's say 10px top and bottom but none to left and right. I'll set the box sizing to border box

32
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:13,300
so that the padding is included in the box size and with that, this should be a nicely looking order.

33
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:21,250
I can now import the classes from this css file from the orders.css file

34
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,330
and assign them here.

35
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:28,260
So class name can now be classes.order.

36
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:33,100
So this is how one order should look like in the orders component,

37
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:40,430
I obviously want to output multiple orders, actually as many orders as needed and the orders I need to output

38
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:43,490
of course should be fetched from the backend.

39
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,540
Now for that, I'll

40
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,310
first of all go to firebase

41
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:51,640
and actually I'm going to clean up my orders here because I got so many.

42
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:57,080
So to make this easier, I'll delete the whole orders node and simply create some new ones thereafter,

43
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:02,440
I'll also set meat to 0 again so that we start with an empty burger.

44
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:09,410
Now with that let's go back to the application, and in here in the orders component, let's for now just

45
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,590
output one dummy order.

46
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,880
So I'll import that order component

47
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:20,690
we just created and then I'll navigate into the components folder, into the order folder and grab that order.js

48
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:24,140
file and then here in jsx

49
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:31,110
as I said, here I'll have a wrapping div around this page and there I'll actually just output

50
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:35,090
let's say two orders so that we can see what it looks like.

51
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:38,140
Now before we populate this with real data,

52
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:45,700
let's load this route. And the orders page should of course be loaded instead of the burger builder or

53
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,240
the check out page.

54
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:52,990
So it's in the app.js file where we set the routes up where all to want to set up a route for the

55
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,140
orders. For that,

56
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:05,440
I'll first of all import orders from

57
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,070
./containers/orders/orders.js

58
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:12,560
and then I'll add this new route here. For let's say /orders,

59
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,990
I want to go to the orders component that's the route outside of an

60
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,100
app.js

61
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:22,890
Now to view this route, we'll have to do something which we haven't done yet

62
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,120
we have to add a link

63
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:29,850
and for that we actually have to touch our navigation items here.

64
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,520
Let's do this in the next lecture.
