We have the burger builder project and there are some things we'll adjust in this module. We need to

2
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:14,390
add a new view, the sign up and sign in view, I'll combine it in one view where we can create new users or

3
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,830
log users in.

4
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:21,740
We also want to protect some routes on the frontend, guard them so that for example we can't access

5
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,850
the orders route if we're not authenticated.

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:33,070
And additionally, I also want to pass that token we'll receive onto the backend for requests to protect

7
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,850
resources so that we can make sure that this does not work.

8
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:43,480
These are the adjustments we have to make on our frontend and to make them,

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:49,100
we first of all will start with the sign up and sign in view because without having users, all the

10
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,640
other things are kind of hard to do.
