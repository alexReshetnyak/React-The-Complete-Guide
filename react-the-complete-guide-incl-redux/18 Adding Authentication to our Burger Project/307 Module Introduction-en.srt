Welcome to this module, you learned so much about react, redux and all the core features of both libraries.

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,410
We built an amazing application with all these tools.

3
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:18,690
But one thing is missing, one thing that is not really related to react necessarily but what you have

4
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,110
in a lot of applications, authenticating users.

5
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:28,400
And I want to show you how this would work in a react single page application, single page application

6
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:33,600
because if you have a multi-page application where you render different pages for different requests

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,200
from your server, you handle authentication in the traditional way of having a session on the server

8
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:46,740
and returning different pages after checking the validity of the user or the authentication status on

9
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,470
the server.

10
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:53,730
Now the special thing about authentication in react is that you have only one file and thereafter, you

11
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,200
get no new file,

12
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:02,970
so you can check the authentication status of the user on the server but not on every request, at least

13
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,780
not in the traditional model.

14
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,020
So that is what we'll have a look at, how does this work in react

15
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,030
and of course, we'll also implement authentication in our burger project.
