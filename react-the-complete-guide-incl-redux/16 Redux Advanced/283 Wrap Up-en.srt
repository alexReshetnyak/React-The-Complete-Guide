1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:03,560
So you learned a lot about redux

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:09,650
over the last lectures and modules. I emphasized that there are alternatives and I showed you some best

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:14,380
practices, good practices and ways to optimize your reducers and actions.

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:21,990
You learned how to run asynchronous code with action creators like this one, how to use the redux-thunk

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,950
middleware to do that,

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:31,100
you learned how to combine reducers and how to use the redux dev tools to get insights into your store

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,840
and even travel back in time if you want to.

8
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:41,630
These are all useful tools and redux is an extremely powerful library you'll see in a lot of react

9
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:47,310
applications. We'll now also go back to our burger builder and enhance this a bit more

10
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:53,090
by for example adding asynchronous code and in conjunction with redux, and chances are you'll also work

11
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,220
with it in your next project.

12
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,600
The basics of this module should have you well prepared.
