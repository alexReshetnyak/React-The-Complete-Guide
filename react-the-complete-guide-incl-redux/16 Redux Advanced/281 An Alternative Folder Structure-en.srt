1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:09,700
With the adjustments of the last lectures, we got leaner reducer files. Generally, we split our actions

2
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:16,570
and reducers across a lot of files and created a lot of boilerplate code here. For a small project as this

3
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:16,970
one,

4
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:23,160
this is clearly overkill but also it allows me to show you what you can do and that will become important

5
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:25,510
as you build bigger applications.

6
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:31,060
We'll already see some advantages in the burger builder app which we'll work on in the next course module

7
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,280
again.

8
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:39,610
I wanted to highlight these possible improvements or restructurings to allow you to write as lean and

9
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:46,300
understandable reducers actions and react applications in general as possible.

10
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:53,110
Now one other thing I want to quickly dive into is an alternative folder structure,

11
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:59,110
now the folder structure really is something you can find styles of different approaches,

12
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:04,360
the approach I chose in this course is the one you'll probably see the most often in react projects,

13
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:09,760
it's quite good with the containers and components differentiation and then the store.

14
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:16,480
Now as your store grows, you might add more and more action and reducer files and you'll notice that

15
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:22,510
some of your reducer files refer to some container and other reducer files to another container.

16
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:30,910
For that reason, in an alternative project structure, you could create a store subfolder in every container

17
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:39,060
and then only add the reducer and the actions for that given container to that store.

18
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:45,010
And if you had more containers, each container folder had a store folder, you wouldn't have that global

19
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:50,560
store folder and you would have a lot of actions and reducers for each container which you then still

20
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,140
combine together in your index.js file though.

21
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,970
So this is an alternative,

22
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:02,080
you can also mix that with a global store for some global or shared operations you might need everywhere,

23
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:08,240
that really is something you can fine tune and where you can read a lot of articles with a lot of opinions.

24
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,950
Find the approach you like, for many projects,

25
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:16,800
the approach shown here with a central store folder should be fine

26
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,810
but be aware that you're free to deviate from that when needed.
