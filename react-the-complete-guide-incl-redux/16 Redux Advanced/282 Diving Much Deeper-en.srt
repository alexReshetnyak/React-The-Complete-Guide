00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,050
So over the last lectures and modules you learned a lot about redux,

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,920
I'm now on redux.js.org,

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:14,000
the official page of the redux package and always keep in mind, redux is a standalone framework

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,050
or library,

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,320
it's not part of react

6
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:22,730
but of course it's commonly used with react, which is why you find a lot of redux plus react resources

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,470
on that official redux page too.

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:33,110
Of course you're taking the course to learn stuff by viewing videos, redux however has so many use cases

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,860
and possible adjustments you can look into that I strongly recommend having a look at this page

10
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:46,460
if you feel like your current approach has you stuck or your reducer functions are exploding, you

11
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:51,970
can learn more about possible alternative practices and best practices here.

12
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:58,070
Now most of the content covered on this page has been covered in the basics and this advanced module

13
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:04,880
though, so no need to dive right into it right now and go through all of that, just see it as a fallback

14
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:10,760
page you can go ahead and look at if something is unclear or there is some use case where you are not sure

15
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,940
how to handle it.

16
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:18,230
One especially useful resource I want to point you to though is the immutable update patterns article

17
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:22,230
here under recipes, on the redux page.

18
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:27,840
If you click on it, you'll read more about how you update nested objects and arrays

19
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:35,270
immutably, this can be tricky since you have to go down to all nested levels. If you have an object with

20
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:40,540
an object with an object inside of it and you want to change something in the deeply nested object,

21
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,900
you have to clone all three first

22
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:49,280
as shown here before you can actually update something immutably and you can see some patterns and examples

23
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:55,340
in this article that might be a great help to make sure you're updating everything in the way you want

24
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,030
to update it. With that,

25
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,290
we covered a lot about redux.

26
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:05,060
It's time to move on to the course project again and update that too.
