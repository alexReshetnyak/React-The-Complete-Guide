00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:07,790
We got a nice looking application we added a lot of functionality over the last lectures,

2
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:15,320
now of course we want to have a really good application not only by the looks of it but also by the

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,480
way we structure it,

4
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:20,460
we work with it. Now throughout building this application,

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,900
I already showed you a lot of best practices for building that, I shared my thought process on how to

6
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:32,230
structure and plan the application and I gave you some alternatives at some points of time on how you may

7
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,540
split something into components.

8
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:38,410
Here we actually have a relatively granular component structure,

9
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,970
you could certainly combine some of the components we're using

10
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,640
but can you also improve some things.

11
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:52,960
Let's dive into two important things we learned about, prop types and pure components.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,750
So in shouldComponentUpdate

13
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:00,420
and let's also have a look at all these lifecycle methods you learned about in general.

14
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,840
Do we use them in there?

15
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:06,450
Why don't we use them at any point right now? Where would we use them?

16
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,400
Let's answer these questions over the next lectures.
