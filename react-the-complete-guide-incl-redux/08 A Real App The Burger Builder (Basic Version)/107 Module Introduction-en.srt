00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:07,640
Welcome to this module. Now we covered a lot of the basics and a lot of theory about react.

2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:13,660
Well thankfully not just theory, we also built a project but this was more a demo project.

3
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:19,880
It's time to build a real react application so that we can see all these concepts come together, so

4
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:26,570
that you can get an idea how you actually plan such an application and how you build this tree of components

5
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:31,730
and successfully use all the concepts you learned thus far in an application.

6
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,870
So that's what we're going to do in this module,

7
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:40,790
we're going to build a burger application so an application where we can or the user can dynamically

8
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:47,510
build a burger, add ingredients and then in the end of course also purchase it. We'll start with the planning

9
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:48,090
phase

10
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:52,220
and that actually is the first thing I want to have a look at in the next lecture.

11
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,530
How do we plan a react application?
