00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,810
Our burger builder is now looking pretty good,

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:11,650
one thing I just noticed though is if we build a burger and we order it, the total sum is missing in

3
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:12,850
the order summary.

4
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:14,320
So let's quickly add that here

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:20,990
too so that we can really call this finished and then move on to the toolbar and so on.

6
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:24,070
Now of course adding the price is pretty straightforward,

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:30,910
we have our orders summary component here and all we need to do is basically add some information below

8
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:37,780
this ingredient summary we have here in the order summary component and there you could say total price

9
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:44,970
and then maybe we'll make everything here strong I guess, so let's wrap this all in strong tags

10
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,160
so that we have this printed out with font-weight

11
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:48,910
bold.

12
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:54,780
Of course you would also use css here to adjust this and then here I want to output the price, now for that,

13
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:59,190
I'll simply accept the price property in order summary,

14
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:05,710
that of course means that in the burger builder where we used the order summary, I now also have to pass

15
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:13,240
the price as a property to that component, so simply access this state and there we have the total price.

16
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:20,290
With these changes, if you save both components you should have a burger which you can now build an order

17
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,580
and get the price here

18
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:27,500
too. Now one thing we can of course still improve about this price and we should improve

19
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:35,280
is the same thing we did in the build controls. There where we also output the price, recalling toFixed

20
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,620
too to prevent this floating point number by

21
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:43,160
javascript sometimes has and to also always display two decimal places.

22
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,380
So let's do this in the order summary too, on the price we're outputting.

23
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,480
Let's call toFixed

24
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,950
too and now with that, we should have a price which always looks like that.

25
00:01:53,950 --> 00:02:00,280
Now we can call this finished and now we can turn towards our completion of this application by adding a

26
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,990
toolbar and the side drawer and so on.
