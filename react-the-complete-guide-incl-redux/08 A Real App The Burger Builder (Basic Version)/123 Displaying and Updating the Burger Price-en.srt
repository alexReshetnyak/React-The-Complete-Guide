1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:07,250
In the last lecture we made sure that we can also remove ingredients from the burger, now I want to update

2
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:12,560
the burger price and display it as part of that burger too.

3
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:18,800
Now actually, if I add a lot of ingredients to a burger, it is scrollable because we configured it to

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,500
be,

5
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:25,370
so the price should probably display it above the build controls, let's say.

6
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:29,200
So in the build controls here, besides outputting the controls,

7
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:37,930
I want to show the burger price and we can simply use a paragraph here where we say current price colon

8
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,410
and then I expect to get the price passed in with props.

9
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:45,450
So props.price, something like that.

10
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,860
Now the price is calculated in the burger builder container,

11
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:57,500
here we have the total price state. So I want to pass this price to my build controls then because that is where

12
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,670
I just added the usage of that property.

13
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,920
So let's add the price property,

14
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:09,690
the name I just picked in build controls and pass this.state.totalPrice,

15
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:12,750
make sure to save all files and let's have a look,

16
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,560
we see the current price here

17
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,680
and if I add ingredients, you see this price increases, here however we get it back with decimal numbers

18
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:27,280
in javascript so we should fix this and maybe we also want to print that in

19
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,100
well, emphasized.

20
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:39,580
So what we can do in the build controls for one, let's wrap this in a strong tag,

21
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,560
the price so that is basically with font-weight

22
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,640
bold and let's fix it by fixing this price here.

23
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:52,810
Now for that, price needs to be a number but thankfully it is,

24
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:58,880
so now we can call toFixed on it and fix it to two decimal places.

25
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,790
Let's save this

26
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,020
and now we see four

27
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:09,910
and if I start adding, you see the price goes up. I guess we built a quite affordable burger here which

28
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,160
looks really delicious.

29
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,530
So with that, the burger builder is actually in pretty good shape.

30
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,060
The check out button is missing but that's something I will add in a second

31
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:26,890
and thereafter we need to take care about all that navigation which is hidden here at the top.
