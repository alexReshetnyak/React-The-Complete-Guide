1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:04,200
In the last lecture, we added the sideDrawer

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:09,680
and of course this is looking horrible because logo and navigation items need to be adjusted to look good

3
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,200
on mobile devices.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,500
Let's start with the logo, it

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:21,470
right now is so big because the logo height is set to 80% and 80% in the sideDrawer means

6
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,480
80% of the full sizeDrawer height here,

7
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,150
that of course is a little bit too much.

8
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:35,080
Now how can we adjust this? We could add some responsive design to the logo.css

9
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:41,900
file, we could set the default to something like 11% and add a media query to wrap this up

10
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,970
to 80% for bigger screens

11
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,990
but that would make our logo harder to reuse. Instead

12
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:55,790
I'm a fan of controlling the logo height in the place where we embed it instead of in the logo component.

13
00:00:55,790 --> 00:01:02,150
So I actually will even set the logo height back to 100% and we should restrict its height in the

14
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:07,560
toolbar and in the sideDrawer to fit the specific needs of these components.

15
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,370
So let's start with the toolbar,

16
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:13,220
as I said, the logo should only be 80% high here,

17
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:21,650
we can achieve this in two ways. We could add a prop to actually set the height dynamically so we could

18
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:28,430
add something like height here which we could set to let's say 80%

19
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,610
and then in the logo, we can accept this,

20
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:38,480
we do accept props here and we could set inline styles here to overwrite the css class settings, to

21
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:43,850
basically assign a javascript object here where we set height to props.height.

22
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:53,270
If we save this, it should now look good in the toolbar still and if we do that in the sideDrawer too, there

23
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:56,790
we would also now simply pass a height to the logo,

24
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,220
let's say not props,

25
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,160
height should be 11% here,

26
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,280
now it should look good in a sideDrawer too.

27
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:12,680
This is one clever way of adjusting this, setting the height as a property where we simply pass the percentage

28
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:19,580
height to the logo component and in the component, assign it dynamically via inline styles.

29
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,850
Nothing wrong with this approach, it should work fine,

30
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,520
I want to show you an alternative to that though.

31
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:29,960
I'll actually leave that property set up here so that we could use that

32
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,130
but I will not use it,

33
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:41,930
I will instead follow a different approach and wrap logo into a div in the sideDrawer and also in the

34
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,190
toolbar,

35
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:50,360
so let's wrap logo into a div in both components and not use this.height property which again just to

36
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,270
highlight this would not have been a bad approach at all.

37
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:58,070
And now these divs which wrap the logo, they should control the height,

38
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:03,500
we can do this with inline styles or with a css class like

39
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:10,270
for example here in the toolbar classes logo and the cool thing is I can now use the logo class here

40
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:17,060
the toolbar component even though I'm already using it in the logo component because due to css modules,

41
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,870
it will convert

42
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:25,190
my css class names into different names and to scope names, so that even though I write two identical

43
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:32,210
classes in the development mode here, it actually converts that to two different css classes which

44
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:35,100
get assigned so that they don't interfere.

45
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:45,040
So now I can define that logo class in my toolbar and there, I can set height to 80% and I can now

46
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:52,930
go to the sideDrawer and there, I can also define a logo class and set the height to 11% here.

47
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:59,860
And now I can use that here in the sideDrawer and assign my class name there too

48
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:06,760
so also set classes.Logo here. And again, I do have that logo class defined in three different files

49
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:13,630
but due to css modules, this is actually converted to three different css classes so that they don't interfere.

50
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,810
With all these changes saved,

51
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,820
we have a nice looking logo here in the sideDrawer and in the toolbar.

52
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:25,630
So you saw different approaches of adjusting this dynamically and making sure that it looks good on

53
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,960
all the devices we need to support.

54
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,350
Let's next work on the navigation items then.
