1
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:06,040
In the last lecture we added this toggle button and it works fine,

2
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:11,130
let's now make sure that we actually turn this into something more pretty.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,420
For that, I'll add a css file to my drawerToggle component,

4
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:23,450
drawerToggle.css and in there, I want to style this as a hamburger icon. Now attached to this video, you

5
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:30,320
will find the css code which is responsible for that and this code essentially just creates a div

6
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:36,290
with three bars inside of it where each bar is one of the hamburger icon bars.

7
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:42,460
Now to make that css code work, we need to adjust the actual html or jsx code,

8
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,760
so there we no longer have a div which wraps the menu text

9
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:52,510
instead what we'll have is a div which holds three div elements inside of it.

10
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,190
And these div elements don't have any content,

11
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:59,050
don't have any css class due to the assigned styling

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:05,240
they will be styled correctly because I'm styling all divs which are nested in a div or in any element

13
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:10,610
which has the drawerToggle class. That of course means we have to assign this drawerToggle class

14
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:11,830
to the outer div.

15
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:23,510
So i'll import classes from the css file to get access to that class and then add class name to the outer

16
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:31,230
div and assign classes drawerToggle referring to that drawerToggle css class which is set up there.

17
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,990
So make sure all files are saved

18
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,730
and let's then have a look at that,

19
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:41,930
and here we see the nice looking hamburger icon. And with it we get a pretty nice looking application

20
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:47,410
where we can build our own burger, check it out, continue

21
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,820
which doesn't do too much yet and have a lot of nice looking functionality in there.

22
00:01:53,040 --> 00:02:00,210
Now over the next modules, we'll add more functionality like sending this or the data to a real server, adding

23
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:06,630
multiple pages and handling the application state differently but I'm already pretty happy with this

24
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:13,980
state of the application and I'd say let's now have a look at how we may optimize this or what we can

25
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,390
fine tune about that before we move on with other course modules.
