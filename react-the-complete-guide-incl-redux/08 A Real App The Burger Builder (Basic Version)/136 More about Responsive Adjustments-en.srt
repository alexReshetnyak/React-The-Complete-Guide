1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:08,000
In the last lecture we adjusted to logo to look good in both the toolbar and the sideDrawer,

2
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:15,100
now let's adjust navigation items too. Right now, negation items especially the single items here

3
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,810
are only styled to look good on desktop devices.

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,880
That's of course the issue, on mobile devices,

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,650
we still have that desktop look

6
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:28,600
but instead I want to have some items which simply sit beneath each other and which are not having

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,090
this border at the bottom and so on.

8
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:37,240
So we have to adjust the navigation items and it will do this with media queries in the navigation

9
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,260
items css file.

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:46,600
So here, I want to write this in a mobile first way so my base classes should be for mobile devices and

11
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,990
then I'll add media queries to make it look good on bigger devices too.

12
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:57,730
So to achieve this, let's first of all add this desktop device media queries or the single media

13
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:04,440
query it actually is. I'll write media and then min-width, for me the cut off point here will be 500px

14
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:07,360
but of course you can choose a different one. I'll now

15
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,650
copy all the existing css classes into that media query because we did write for desktop before

16
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:19,870
so we definitely want to use these classes for broader devices and now I want to adjust these base classes

17
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,940
to look good on mobile.

18
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:27,970
This for example includes to have a margin of 10px from top and bottom and zero to top and right

19
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,400
so there is some spacing between my links.

20
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:40,050
I also want to set the width now to 100% but not the height, the height should be only taking the

21
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:47,120
height it needs from a text perspective and the display doesn't have to be flex, the display can be block

22
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,670
here

23
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,990
and I also don't need align-items for that reason.

24
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:57,580
Now for a given link, the color should not be white because the background of the sideDrawer is white,

25
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,600
I want to use a brown color here and I will use #8F5C2C,

26
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:08,770
the brown color we used before, text-decoration of course still is none, the height is not

27
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,800
100% though but the width is.

28
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:17,010
I also want to make sure that box-sizing is border box so we'll leave that

29
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,530
but I don't need the padding,

30
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,410
I don't need the border bottom,

31
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:24,410
this can all go and display can still be set to block though.

32
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,010
Now for active items, I don't want to set the background color to brown,

33
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:36,000
I want to set it to this blue color instead, not the background color excuse me, the color,

34
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,420
so the text color and I'll get rid of background color and border bottom,

35
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,740
I don't want to have any of that.

36
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,840
And as always you're of course free to adjust this to a way you find to look nicer.

37
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,060
So these are my mobile styles,

38
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:54,420
now let's throw out any duplicate styling setups we have in mobile and desktop. For example box-sizing border

39
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,050
box,

40
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,270
we already defined this in mobile,

41
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:03,240
we don't need to redefine it here because media queries of course are merged with the original classes

42
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:09,360
so whatever we set up here is generally capped and then we can override selected properties but block

43
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,470
sizing doesn't need to be overwritten because we want to use the same value.

44
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:20,220
I will use the same values here but I'll set the width too auto here to not use the width of 100%

45
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:26,570
which I did set up in the mobile settings though, I'll also overwrite the other settings,

46
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:27,990
so this looks good to me.

47
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:34,720
for a selected link here, I now want to set the color to white

48
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,200
so here it is brown,

49
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,870
it should be white for me.

50
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,960
Text-decoration is already set up in the mobile settings,

51
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,330
height and padding, that's important for me.

52
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,610
Border bottom is important,

53
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:48,160
box-sizing and display,

54
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:53,450
we got that set up here in the mobile settings already so we can get rid of it down here.

55
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:58,150
And for hovering and active links, everything needs to be set up because we have a totally different

56
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,490
style for mobile links.

57
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:03,400
Let's now save this and have a look at it,

58
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:07,470
it's looking good but they're still sitting next to each other.

59
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,980
The reason for this is that

60
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:14,340
our navigation items, the unordered list which wraps the links, there

61
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:15,820
we're using flexbox

62
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,900
and that leads to the item sitting next to each other by default.

63
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:26,180
Isn't a problem, we just need to add a media query here too with min-width 500px

64
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:33,990
and in there, I'll now set up my navigation items class and I will set the flex flow to row here because

65
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,410
keep in mind, this is the media query for desktop devices

66
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,840
so there they should sit next to each other

67
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:47,100
but for mobile devices, I will actually set a new flex flow of column so that they sit beneath each

68
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,170
other.

69
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:54,350
Now if we save this, we see the items are indeed stacked on top of each other, on bigger screens,

70
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,220
we still have the old look.

71
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:02,430
We also get a couple of issues here, by the way the distorted burger when switching is only due to the

72
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,330
switching,

73
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:09,300
once you reload and load the app as the user would see it, it's looking fine, but we got issues here, for

74
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:16,230
example the navigation items are also visible on the toolbar on smaller screens

75
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,140
and of course, that should not be the case,

76
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:22,190
I don't want to have the navigation items in the toolbar on small screens,

77
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,450
I have the sideDrawer for that.

78
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:30,740
I also want to have a little bit more spacing between the logo and my navigation items here on mobile.

79
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:40,570
To fix this, I'll go back to my application and there in the sideDrawer where I include the logo and the navigation

80
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:48,670
items, I'll first of all add some margin to the button on the logo so that we have some spacing to the

81
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:53,590
navigation items which are below it, maybe 32px

82
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,420
so that should look better

83
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:55,910
yes.

84
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:02,560
And to remove the navigation items in the toolbar, we actually need to add a new helper css class

85
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,210
which I'll adds to the wrapping element. I'll add it

86
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:17,120
and I'll add it in a media query. So this media query will now check if the maximum width is 499px,

87
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:24,910
so if we are on a mobile device. Then I'll add my desktop only css class and there I will set the

88
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:27,140
display to none.

89
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,700
I don't have this class for the default case

90
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:36,550
so for devices which are broader than 500px but that basically means that it takes the default

91
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:41,140
styling which is display block and therefore it will be visible.

92
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:44,140
So I only overwrite this for small devices,

93
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:50,980
now I can use this new class in a toolbar though and can add it here to the nav item, to the nav element.

94
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,600
I can use classes desktop only

95
00:06:53,710 --> 00:07:00,180
and now on smaller devices, the navigation items should disappear and they do. We see the logo here

96
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:03,810
but I think that looks quite nice so maybe we'll leave that here.

97
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:10,580
Now with that we got a sideDrawer which looks better, it would look even better if you would have a backdrop

98
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,980
and if we could dynamically open and close it.

99
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,560
These are the steps we'll work on next.
