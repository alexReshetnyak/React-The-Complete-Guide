1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:06,520
In the last lecture we created the individual build control component.

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,010
Now we want to output a couple of build controls

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:18,790
and for that, I will create a constant, not the state, not a property just another constant in this file

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,930
but one which I won't export which i'll name controls.

5
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:28,540
And this is optional, you could just hard code all the controls but I want to have an array for which

6
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:35,770
I can loop to conveniently build all these build controls and render them. So here I want to have a couple of

7
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:44,110
javascript objects, each should have a label like salad and then a type, also salad but with a lowercase

8
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:47,560
s and this is just one possible approach.

9
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:55,300
Now I will replicate this for all the ingredients I know I know in this app I mean, bacon for example

10
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:05,970
cheese and the types by the way should meet the types you're checking for in the burger ingredient component

11
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,580
in that switch statement, you should have the same casing and so on

12
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,210
as here, in the type property.

13
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:19,000
Now we get an array of controls and again this was just added for convenience,

14
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:24,170
I now want to use it here in my build control component.

15
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:30,790
First of all I will use the build controls css class so I will quickly add import to that classes

16
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:37,630
from ./buildControls css and assign this to the wrapping

17
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:45,070
div here, build excuse me, classes.BuildControls, like this.

18
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:52,280
And now inside of that div, I want to loop through all the controls and render a build control for each

19
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,590
of them.

20
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:59,010
So let's first import the build control singular component

21
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:05,480
we created in the last lecture. We can find in the build control folder and there it's the build control

22
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,910
javascript file.

23
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:16,210
Now let's create a loop with curly braces to inline it here because it's really short, take that controls

24
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:20,190
constant which is part of this file in which we therefore can access here

25
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,060
because always keep in mind you're in javascript here,

26
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,020
of course you can access other stuff from this file.

27
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:37,760
So access controls, call map there and now map each control, so each element of this array into a build

28
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:46,860
control, a self-closing tag, where you set a key that's required. The key can't just be the label because

29
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,620
that is a unique identifier,

30
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:59,600
we never have a label more than once, and then also pass label to this build control component.

31
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,810
Now the type will become important later,

32
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:06,800
for now let's see if we can see something.

33
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:12,590
So make sure you save all the files and now that we export build controls,

34
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,480
let's go to the burger builder and insert it here

35
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:19,000
instead of this placeholder.

36
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:25,190
So let's add import here at the top, buildControls from

37
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:32,180
and now we need to go into the components folder, into the burger folder, the build controls folder and

38
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:40,640
pick the buildControls javascript file and now simply output it here in place of that div, build controls

39
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,470
a self-closing element.

40
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:50,540
Now if you save that and make sure all files are saved, you should see these build controls below the burger

41
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:55,450
and these build controls won't do anything just yet

42
00:03:55,610 --> 00:04:01,700
but we're really close to hooking up these buttons and hence editing this burger.
