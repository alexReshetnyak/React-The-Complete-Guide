1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,870
Let's start with prop types,

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:08,070
right now we're doing prop type validation in the burger ingredient component.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:15,170
There we make sure that the type is set so it's required and that it is a string.

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,100
I'm not doing any validation in any other component

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,180
and the reason for this is that here

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,250
I'm not working on a project which is going to get used by other people,

7
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,580
I'm not working on a third party library,

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,250
I'm not even working in a developer team.

9
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,620
So a lot of the reasons why properties might be used incorrectly aren't relevant here

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:46,650
Additionally we'll get logical errors in our application if we forget or assign a wrong key property

11
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:47,530
anyways

12
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,250
and that is why I don't use prop type validation that much in this application.

13
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,100
Now as an exercise,

14
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,410
definitely feel free to add prop

15
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,870
type validation to some or all of the components.

16
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:08,010
Just keep in mind that you will have to convert them from functional components to class based stateful

17
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:15,060
components which isn't bad per se, you can absolutely do that but it's also a good practice to not unnecessarily

18
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:22,770
do that and instead use as many stateless functional components as possible and therefore really only

19
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,380
do it if it makes sense

20
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,970
but again for practice purposes, feel free to validate more prop types.
