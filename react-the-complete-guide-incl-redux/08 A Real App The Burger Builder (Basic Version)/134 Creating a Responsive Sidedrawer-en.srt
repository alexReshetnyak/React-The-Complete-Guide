1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:06,120
In the last lecture we added the navigation items for the toolbar

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,260
only right now.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,580
So it's time to also add the navigation for mobile devices, for this,

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:20,040
the menu button here should show a sideDrawer, so some side menu which slides in. For that, I'll add

5
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,550
a new component in the navigation folder,

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,220
the sideDrawer component in a sideDrawer folder.

7
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:37,530
Now the sideDrawer here will consist of two components you could say, the sideDrawer itself and then the

8
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,320
toggle button which right now is simply handled here with a placeholder,

9
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,360
the menu button here, that should be a button which opens the sideDrawer in the end

10
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:52,670
and that can therefore go into its own component since we theoretically might want to reuse such a toggle

11
00:00:52,750 --> 00:01:00,510
button. Also, we will need a backdrop for the sideDrawer but thankfully, we already got one so we'll reuse

12
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:01,750
this component.

13
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,090
Let's work on the sideDrawer first and let's always show it,

14
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,410
then let's add the toggle button and so on

15
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,430
so let's get there step by step.

16
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:19,080
The sideDrawer component is a normal functional component where we get some props and return something, that

17
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:25,820
something will not be the jsx code immediately but a real function body we'll use here

18
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:31,950
because before I return jsx in there, I want to do something here,

19
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:39,150
I basically want to conditionally attach different css classes to make sure we play some animation when

20
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,500
the drawer is shown.

21
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:46,560
So we'll add an open class which kind of slides it in and a close class which kind of slides it out, you'll

22
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,980
see how to implement this in a second.

23
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:55,510
Of course let's also import react so that our jsx code can get compiled,

24
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:01,630
and let's then export the sideDrawer function as the file default.

25
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:08,160
Now before we add any conditional classes, let's set up the sideDrawer and here I'll simply use a div

26
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,520
like this

27
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,530
and in that div here, I want to have my logo and my navigation items,

28
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:27,990
so I'll import both. I'll import logo from the logo folder and there, the logo.js file and I'll import navigation items

29
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:34,560
from the navigation items folder then and there, the navigation items js

30
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,330
file,

31
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:39,240
so here you can already see how we're reusing components.

32
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:46,530
And then I'll add logo as a self-closing component here and wrap navigation items into a nav element

33
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,180
and yes, you could also therefore outsource nav into navigation items,

34
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,540
just make sure to also adjust the styling there then because right now, I'm styling nav in toolbar,

35
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:01,600
you would have to move that into navigation items, but that would absolutely be possible.

36
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:08,140
So here I'll include navigation items as a self-closing element for now in the sideDrawer

37
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,840
and now of course, the sideDrawer needs some styling too.

38
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:17,730
So for that, I'll create a new css file next to the sideDrawer.js file,

39
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,680
the sideDrawer.css file. In there,

40
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:28,830
I'll add a sideDrawer class and the sideDrawer will only be visible on small device screens, I will take

41
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,310
care that you can only open it there.

42
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:36,630
So let's set the position to fix then because it should always be on the page even if we scroll, it should

43
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,050
feel like a static element.

44
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:48,040
I want to set the width to let's say 200px or maybe 280px and the max-width should be 70%

45
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,670
so that even on super narrow devices, it doesn't go over the edges.

46
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:59,010
The height has to be 100% to take the full screen height and the left position should be 0

47
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,580
and the top positions should be 0 so that it really sits on the full screen.

48
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:11,040
I'll then give it a set index of 200, deliberately having a higher number than the backdrop of course

49
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:15,110
where we used 100 because the sideDrawer should be above the backdrop

50
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:20,820
otherwise it would be hard to use it. I'll then want to give it a background color of white so that it

51
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:28,300
stands out and that we can clearly see all the content of the sideDrawer and I'll assign some padding let's say 32px

52
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:32,180
from top to bottom and 16px left to right

53
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:37,210
and you can of course also use percent, well use here if you prefer to do that.

54
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:44,590
I'll give it some box-sizing to adjust the size to the padding and now important, I'll add a transition

55
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:52,150
property to react to changes of the transform property and animate them over 300 millisecond with the

56
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,500
ease out timing function,

57
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:58,650
this will be important for opening and closing the sideDrawer.

58
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:05,630
Next I'll add a media query here to determine what should happen on bigger devices,

59
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:14,650
if our device width exceeds 500px, then the sideDrawer css class should actually have a display of none,

60
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,200
so it's just not visible,

61
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:19,650
so we can never see the sideDrawer on bigger devices.

62
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:24,120
Now for testing, we will have to switch into mobile device mode in the browser

63
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:32,550
therefore, I'll also add two new css classes, open and close and these will be attached conditionally

64
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:39,690
and they are responsible for playing an animation. For open, I'll set the transformed property to

65
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,050
translateX(0),

66
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:48,660
this will basically shift the sideDrawer into the position I defined up here and for close, I'll set transform

67
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,400
to translateX minus 100%,

68
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,210
this will shift it to the left,

69
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:59,910
and since we constantly switch between these classes, transform will be adjusted and hence it'll play

70
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:03,510
with a transition. This is the sideDrawer class,

71
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:08,200
let's now go into the sideDrawer and let's import the classes there.

72
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:17,820
So let's import classes from the sideDrawer css file and let's add this to the div, class name here should

73
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:22,590
be classes.SideDrawer with a capital S.

74
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,240
So now the sideDrawer component is configured and should look good,

75
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,140
now of course, we want to use it

76
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,000
and that brings up one important question, where should the sideDrawer component be used at?

77
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:39,490
In the app.js file? In the toolbar file?

78
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:44,630
Neither of the two of course, we got our layout and in the layout, we have the toolbar.

79
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:50,520
It's here where we also should have the sideDrawer because it's part of our core layout in my opinion.

80
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:58,670
So I'll import the sideDrawer here from, and now I need to go into the navigation folder, to the side

81
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:07,400
drawer folder and to the sideDrawer.js file and now simply import or add this here, add the sideDrawer here

82
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:15,000
in this layout component. With that, if we go back to the application and we click on this mobile device

83
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,440
preview icon here in the chrome dev tools,

84
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:23,890
alternatively you can just shrink your screen size. From a certain point on, you should see the sideDrawer

85
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:30,150
and it should look horrible because the logo is way too big and the navigation items of course look

86
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,080
bad.

87
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:36,570
That makes sense because we have adjusted neither of the two to look good on mobile devices,

88
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:42,170
so let's take care about this next before we then add the backdrop and a working toggle button.
