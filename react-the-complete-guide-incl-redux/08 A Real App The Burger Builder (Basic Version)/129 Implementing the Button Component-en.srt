1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,980
In the last lecture, we created our own button component,

2
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:10,110
let's now use it in the order summary where we have two buttons.

3
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:21,080
First of all in that component, I'll import my own button from the UI folder, there from, not from the backdrop,

4
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:25,070
from the button folder, the button.js file

5
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:34,380
and now, we can simply replace the default button here with my own button as we set it up to output props.

6
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:43,970
children, here we can simply wrap the text we want to put on the button with our own button element.

7
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:50,770
Now there are two properties we need to define on the button, clicked and button type,

8
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,050
so let's quickly do that,

9
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:59,870
let's start with button type maybe, for cancel I want to set button type to Danger and make sure to

10
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:07,150
use a capital D because you need to match the name we use here in the button.css file,

11
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,600
Danger and Success,

12
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,580
these are the two values we can use.

13
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,140
You can of course change them or add new ones

14
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,630
but these are the ones I supplied you with.

15
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,700
So button type danger

16
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:28,100
and on the second one button type success, like that and of course as I said there is this

17
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:33,580
click property which it also uses, which the button component also uses.

18
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,140
So we should also set up clicked,

19
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:43,170
this will be triggered when the button is clicked and of course here we want to execute some method

20
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:50,280
which since we're in the order summary component, we also have to receive here dynamically.

21
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:56,500
Now the order summary component gets used in the burger builder component or container,

22
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:04,770
so therefore we should pass a property to order summary or to properties actually, one which will pass

23
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:10,380
a reference in the case that we want to continue with the purchase, a reference to a method which then handles

24
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,150
this case and a reference to a method which handles the case that

25
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,310
we don't want to continue.

26
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:21,100
We already got a method for not continuing, the purchaseCancelHandler,

27
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,360
now I will add a third method,

28
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,250
purchaseContinueHandler.

29
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:33,750
I'll also define this with this arrow function syntax and there for now I will simply throw an alert,

30
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:41,150
you continue because that is all we can do for now.

31
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:49,160
Now let's pass these two methods references to the order summary and we can choose any property names

32
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,150
we want,

33
00:02:50,150 --> 00:03:00,160
so I'll add a purchaseCanceled event here or property name where I want to execute the purchaseCancelHandler

34
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:09,320
and I'll add the purchaseContinued property which holds a reference to the

35
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,950
purchaseContinueHandler.

36
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:15,620
Now with that, let's implement these two, whoops, cancelled with two L's though,

37
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:20,600
let's implement these two properties in the order summary,

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,610
there we have the buttons,

39
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:29,780
if we click the cancel button, then we want to execute props.purchaseCancelled,

40
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:36,720
if we clicked continue button, we want to execute props.purchaseContinued was the property which holds

41
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,130
the correct method referenced then.

42
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:44,610
Let's see if that works, if we save this and we add ingredients and click order

43
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:47,220
now, here are the buttons.

44
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:56,610
If I click Cancel, it does the same as clicking the backdrop does, it dismisses the modal. If I click continue,

45
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:00,120
I get the alert which says you continue.

46
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:04,090
Now this is the modal and this is the

47
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:10,270
burger builder as far as we can build it from a build the burger side.

48
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:17,630
Later in the course, we'll also add functionality to really kind of make the purchase and store that in

49
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:24,010
a database on a real server where we then probably would process the order if that were a real app

50
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:30,610
and we'll also add more pages so that the user can also see a page of the orders he placed.

51
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:37,700
And of course in case you already know redux, no worries, we'll also overhaul this app with redux.

52
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,320
We're not done yet though,

53
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:40,270
have a look at our app,

54
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,410
what's missing?

55
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:45,750
The toolbar, the sideDrawer and the backdrop for the sideDrawer.

56
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:49,940
Well at least we got the backdrop but here we still got some work to do,

57
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,920
this is what we'll focus on next.
