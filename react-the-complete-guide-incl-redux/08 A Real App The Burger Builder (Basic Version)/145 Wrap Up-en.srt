1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:09,450
So over the last lectures, over this module which was quite long, we built our first react application

2
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:14,180
which looks pretty cool and which works pretty awesome. Here

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,980
we got a lot of features you learned about in the previous core sections. You learned how to plan your

4
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,110
application, how to split it into components, how to have these components communicate with each other

5
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:32,400
via props, how to pass method references to components so that a click on the backdrop triggers a

6
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:37,050
method in another component like in the layout component in our case,

7
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:45,720
these are all core concepts of modern react applications. Being aware of how to communicate, how to structure

8
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,960
it, how to build the components and the pitfalls react offers.

9
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:58,050
Being aware of concepts like the auxiliary higher order components here or the shouldComponentUpdate

10
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,820
mechanism is crucial to building successful react apps.

11
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,630
Now we're not done at all,

12
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:10,200
we'll dive much deeper into react, you will learn how to reach out to the web to save your data there

13
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:17,250
or fetch it from there, you will learn how to handle state in a better way, how to route, how to do a lot

14
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,280
of other awesome things with react.

15
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,000
But here you've got solid foundations and I can only encourage you to play around with this project,

16
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:33,990
enhance it a little bit, add some features, change the styling, add other components, add more ingredients

17
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:39,750
to the burger, whatever you like, play around with it and get better with react.

18
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:47,460
Building projects is the best way of learning anything and that is of course also true for react therefore.
