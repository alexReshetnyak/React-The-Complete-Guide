00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:08,360
In the last lecture, we improved our application a tiny bit by adding shouldComponentUpdate to the modal

2
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:14,050
to make sure we don't update any components there unnecessarily.

3
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:21,620
Now what about other lifecycle methods like componentDidMount or componentDidUpdate and all these

4
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,430
things?

5
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,010
Why don't we use any of them?

6
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:25,910
When would we use them?

7
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:33,230
Well actually you will see some of them being used once we add HTTP. As you saw in the slides in the last

8
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,640
course module,

9
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,710
the componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate lifecycle hooks are extremely important for causing

10
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:40,830
side effects,

11
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:46,130
that sounds strange but in the end just means things like reaching out to a web service and fetching

12
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,610
data from there.

13
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:52,370
Now we're not doing that yet in the application, there is much initialization we have to do in our

14
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:53,230
components.

15
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:59,720
That is why we don't need the lifecycle hooks, other hooks like WillUpdate and so on which we don't use

16
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,620
except for login here,

17
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,110
well you typically don't use these that often.

18
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:12,120
There might be some cases where you need to adjust your components state based on some props you received

19
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,170
from outside

20
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:19,940
and that certainly can occur in bigger react applications but it's also not that uncommon to have react

21
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:26,830
applications where you don't use that many lifecycle hooks except for componentDidUpdate maybe.

22
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:30,520
So that is the reason why you don't see too many of these being used,

23
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,780
there will be more once we add HTTP access

24
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:37,220
as I mentioned but for now this is how the application works and looks.

25
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:43,680
It's a pretty good application showing a lot of features of react and a lot of best practices

26
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:47,070
so let me now summarize it in the next lecture.
