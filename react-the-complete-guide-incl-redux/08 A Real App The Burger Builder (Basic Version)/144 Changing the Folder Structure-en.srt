1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:08,920
So which other change can we implement? Let's have a look at our layout component, in the layout folder

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:15,820
under components. If we have a look at it, it's clearly a class based component and it has a state, a state

3
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:19,330
to handle their display of the sideDrawer.

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:26,230
Now I don't really consider it to be a container, though you could argue for it to be one because obviously

5
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:30,860
it contains some other components and it passes states down to them,

6
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:38,620
so it wouldn't necessarily be wrong to place that layout component here in their containers folder

7
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,380
like this

8
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,650
so now I'll move it over there.

9
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,560
You could also argue for something different with the given folder structure which of course is only

10
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:54,270
just one possible way where I have this hoc folder for higher order components,

11
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:59,220
you could kind of argue that a layout is really just a higher order component,

12
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:06,300
because what you're doing with it is you're wrapping your other components with the layout.

13
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:12,220
So the burger builder component in our application but once we add routing, that of course are going to

14
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,360
be more components.

15
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,410
And in the app.js folder, we're really just wrapping the burger builder with our layout component

16
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,510
and this essentially makes it a higher order component.

17
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,600
These are maybe just semantics,

18
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,800
it doesn't really change the way your application work, how you call your components.

19
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:38,290
Still you could move layout into containers or you could move it into hoc or maybe in your application,

20
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:40,640
you don't really have a hoc folder,

21
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,860
maybe there, you just have containers and components.

22
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,140
There is more than one correct way,

23
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:52,120
now I like this set up though where layout is now in the hoc folder because I consider it a higher

24
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,150
order component,

25
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:59,350
it's only there to wrap other components and therefore here we're using it in app.js to wrap whichever

26
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,460
route we're rendering

27
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,090
hence I move it into the hoc folder.

28
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,290
Now I will also create a new subfolder in hoc

29
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:10,620
therefore, the aux folder and move my aux.js file in there.

30
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:17,290
Now this of course will lead to some errors because now we will have some import issues. In the layout

31
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:23,200
folder, we'll need to adjust our imports to still have correct paths to all the components we depend

32
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,430
on and we'll have to make sure that wherever we're importing aux, we also adjust the path.

33
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,980
So let's quickly do that,

34
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:37,270
I'll start the layout component and I'll start with the aux import since layout is hoc and aux's,

35
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:43,780
we only have to go up one level now to go into the hoc folder, so we can remove that part

36
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:49,370
we already are in there and then move into the aux folder and then import the aux.js file,

37
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,780
so this is how we need to adjust this.

38
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:57,570
The classes import doesn't change of course because there's css files in the same folder but the toolbar

39
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:04,150
import does change, there we need to go all the way up then into the components folder and then we

40
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:11,050
can go into the navigation folder and I can basically copy that part here prior to navigation from the

41
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:14,630
toolbar import and also use it here for the sideDrawer.

42
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,060
So with that, the layout component is updated,

43
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:23,630
Now what I also do is I need to restart and give a start because it seems to break on that aux file

44
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,840
which it really shouldn't,

45
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:29,780
but we'll probably also get some other errors here because we're importing aux

46
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,460
in other files. In the app.js file,

47
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,060
we also need to adjust the import for the layout component

48
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,230
it's of course now in the hoc folder,

49
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,130
so that is something we should adjust.

50
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:45,640
Then in the burger builder as you can see here in the error message, we got to an error because there

51
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:50,630
in the burger builder we are of course using the aux component.

52
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:55,690
So there we need to adjust the import because now it's essentially still in the hoc folder

53
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:02,440
but we created that aux subfolder which we need to adjust. In the sideDrawer component, there

54
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:08,470
we also are using aux and there we also have to go to the aux folder and import the aux.js file from

55
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:14,470
there. In the modal component which is in the UI folder, there we also use aux

56
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:21,870
so we also need to add slash aux at the end here, and in the order summary, we face a similar issue,

57
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,880
there we also need to import the aux file from within the aux folder

58
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:29,750
and with all these changes, now we should have a working application again.

59
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,120
Let's quickly check if it does work,

60
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,370
it's looking good.

61
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:38,710
So now we got an application which works again without throwing any errors

62
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:46,430
but now with our new folder structure, which is optional but which makes more sense in my opinion since

63
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:53,000
or due to the way our components do work. Now with that, we really have a great application,

64
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,160
let's now move on with this course.
