1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:07,660
Now you learned all the theory about how components work, how you pass data around, how props work and

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:08,350
so on

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:12,760
and that's all nice but how do you actually plan a react application,

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,260
how does that work?

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:18,470
Now you can of course split this up into more granular steps than these three

6
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:25,840
but here are three very important steps I see and I regularly go through when planning a react application.

7
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:30,810
The first step is planning the component tree, the component structure,

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:38,620
you probably get a design by your designer or you basically created an app design on your own and now

9
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,760
it's up to you to split this up into react components

10
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:48,880
and it's absolutely normal that the results you may have at the end might look different than your initially

11
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:54,610
planned component tree but it's super important to have an idea about what should go into its own component

12
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:55,950
and what not.

13
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:00,640
The other important part of your application of course is the application state,

14
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,820
you can also translate this with the data you plan on using and manipulating in your application. For example

15
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:11,270
and of course you will do this over the next lectures, in our burger application,

16
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:16,600
we need to keep track about the ingredients a user added because that will determine what we need to

17
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,650
render and also what the user needs to pay at the end.

18
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:27,280
Now once you know the component structure of your application and the state you're going to use in it, you

19
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,100
can plan components versus containers.

20
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:35,650
So which components in your application should be stateless or functional,

21
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:42,690
sometimes also referred to as dumb components and which components have to be stateful components

22
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:49,030
created with that class keyword because they need to manage some state and distribute it down to their

23
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,910
dumber components, to the stateless components.

24
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:59,360
These are the three steps I regularly go through and these are the steps I want to go through with you together.

25
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:05,890
We're going to plan our component tree, component structure and then we're going to have a look at which

26
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:10,540
state we need and what can be a component and what should be a container

27
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:13,570
and then we're just going to start building the application.

28
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:19,570
And as you will see we might then even add more components than we initially planned because we see that

29
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,320
we can split up even more

30
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,660
or maybe that some split

31
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:27,650
we did plan doesn't make sense once we start implementing it and that's perfectly normal.

32
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,950
But having a plan is of course very important.
