So we already got our hands dirty and we saw how we build a React app.

1
00:07.970 --> 00:12.620
Now, this already answers a bit why we might want to use React.

2
00:12.630 --> 00:13.730
There's also more.

3
00:13.730 --> 00:20.760
There are more reasons why we want to use React. React helps us with a problem we'll encounter with normal

4
00:20.760 --> 00:28.900
JavaScript; the UI state becomes difficult to manage. In bigger JavaScript applications,

5
00:28.980 --> 00:34.520
you have to manually target elements in your DOM and if you then change the structure of your HTML

6
00:34.530 --> 00:41.470
code, chances are you will need to change the way you targeted your elements because you used querySelector.

7
00:41.580 --> 00:47.610
Even if you use jQuery, traversing the DOM is easier, but it's still always something you have to

8
00:47.610 --> 00:48.590
keep in mind.

9
00:48.730 --> 00:55.020
If you've got more complex web apps where you dynamically add and remove elements, this quickly can

10
00:55.020 --> 01:02.640
become cumbersome. In our course project, we build an app which is highly dynamic where we are able to build

11
01:02.640 --> 01:06.000
a burger and dynamically add and remove ingredients.

12
01:06.180 --> 01:10.040
If you write this with normal JavaScript code, it's going to be a nightmare.

13
01:10.140 --> 01:16.370
So React helps us by making the whole UI state management a non-issue.

14
01:16.410 --> 01:21.440
It allows us to focus on our business logic instead of keeping our application from exploding.

15
01:21.540 --> 01:26.400
Additionally, React is maintained by a big community.

16
01:26.400 --> 01:31.510
So chances are, the React code is written better than we could have ever written it.

17
01:31.740 --> 01:34.480
So therefore, it's highly-efficient and fast.

18
01:34.560 --> 01:38.850
The bigger your application gets, the more this matters too.

19
01:38.850 --> 01:45.370
Finally, React features a huge ecosystem and an extremely-active community which means that there

20
01:45.370 --> 01:51.210
is a great chance that for a given problem you face, you'll find a solution or an extra package you can

21
01:51.210 --> 01:52.770
add to fix it.

22
01:52.770 --> 01:57.960
All these are reasons why React is awesome and why you definitely should consider it for your next

23
01:57.960 --> 02:01.440
project and why you made the right choice to start with this course.
