So, in the last lecture I explained that React is all about components and that components are awesome.

1
00:08.700 --> 00:12.760
Let's actually see this on a real web page. Here's reactjs.org,

2
00:12.810 --> 00:15.280
which is the official web page

3
00:15.310 --> 00:17.030
of the React team.

4
00:17.250 --> 00:21.550
If we have a look at it, it is actually built with React (of course).

5
00:21.570 --> 00:27.530
This looks like a normal web page and it is; but we can split this up into components.

6
00:27.540 --> 00:33.380
We've got this Header component and in there we've got these Single Navigation Item components.

7
00:33.390 --> 00:42.030
We've got this Starting Image/Call-To-Action component here and we've got all our elements down here

8
00:42.030 --> 00:49.860
where they advertise React and what it is about. We see more components here like these Image Code Snippet

9
00:49.860 --> 00:53.040
components with some descriptions to the left of them.

10
00:53.130 --> 00:59.400
All these things are basically building blocks which we can of course easily consider as reusable pieces

11
00:59.610 --> 01:02.880
and actually they are reusing this element here.

12
01:02.880 --> 01:09.890
We've got one element here and then the same element with different content being used below it.

13
01:09.900 --> 01:15.810
Now, you can hard-code all this with just HTML, JavaScript and CSS, but then you will

14
01:15.810 --> 01:22.050
have to repeat your code over and over again. Here, with components,  you build your own HTML elements,

15
01:22.050 --> 01:24.970
so to say, and then you just reuse those elements.

16
01:25.110 --> 01:31.560
Behind the scenes, this HTML element has all this content already inside of it and we'll see this

17
01:31.560 --> 01:33.680
in detail in a second.

18
01:34.030 --> 01:40.080
Another good example would be Udemy. Here on the Udemy page where I searched for Vue.js

19
01:40.170 --> 01:42.130
(an alternative to React),

20
01:42.150 --> 01:44.880
we see there are a lot of components too.

21
01:44.900 --> 01:47.830
We've got this whole Header with the Search Bar component.

22
01:47.880 --> 01:53.580
We've got this Search Results Summary component that allows us to filter the search results

23
01:54.090 --> 01:56.290
and we also have the search results themselves.

24
01:56.430 --> 01:59.540
We've got reused List Item components here.

25
01:59.670 --> 02:02.060
Each of them has an image and a different title,

26
02:02.250 --> 02:04.680
but in the core they are all the same.

27
02:04.680 --> 02:06.390
They all have the same structure

28
02:06.510 --> 02:13.440
and Udemy also uses a JavaScript framework to achieve this and to allow for easier development and,

29
02:13.560 --> 02:14.760
this is important,

30
02:14.850 --> 02:16.820
maintaining and updating this page.

31
02:16.950 --> 02:22.970
So this is why components are awesome and why we as a developer probably want to use components and that

32
02:22.970 --> 02:25.680
is why React is all about components.
