Now, there's not just React;

1
00:04.030 --> 00:08.330
there are also alternatives. React, of course, is what we'll cover in this course.

2
00:08.380 --> 00:14.350
There is also Angular and Vue.js as well as others like Backbone and Ember, but

3
00:14.380 --> 00:17.730
Angular and Vue are the most popular alternatives.

4
00:17.950 --> 00:22.330
I can only recommend diving into these two to really pick your favorite.

5
00:22.330 --> 00:25.250
I've also got courses on them if you're interested.

6
00:25.600 --> 00:32.500
All three of them are great at creating highly-scalable web applications that look and feel good to

7
00:32.500 --> 00:34.090
the user.

8
00:34.090 --> 00:41.050
Not so much an alternative is jQuery; where he you might think it is, but jQuery is really only about

9
00:41.350 --> 00:44.820
traversing the DOM and targeting elements in the DOM.

10
00:44.830 --> 00:51.490
Now, as you saw in our example, React is about just declaring what you see and focusing on the logic

11
00:51.790 --> 00:59.050
instead of focusing on the 'how'. Therefore, React, Angular and Vue allow you to create more powerful

12
00:59.050 --> 01:05.860
applications because you can focus on the logic and your business model and not so much on the technical

13
01:05.860 --> 01:08.450
side of actually reaching an element

14
01:08.500 --> 01:09.670
you want to change.
