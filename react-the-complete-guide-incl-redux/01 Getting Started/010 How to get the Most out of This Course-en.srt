00:02.210 --> 00:04.030
So let's get started with this course.

1
00:04.070 --> 00:09.200
But first, I want to explain to you how you can get the most out of this course.

2
00:09.200 --> 00:14.950
Obviously, you'll watch the videos and I highly recommend that you also code along; write

3
00:14.960 --> 00:16.260
the code yourself.

4
00:16.400 --> 00:18.640
This is how you'll learn the most.

5
00:18.650 --> 00:21.110
Additionally, check my source code

6
00:21.230 --> 00:27.170
if you're encountering issues. You can find it attached to the end of each module and also to a lot

7
00:27.170 --> 00:34.170
of lectures throughout the module. I provide the source code because sometimes it's just a tiny typo

8
00:34.580 --> 00:39.770
and if you then run my source code and compare it to yours, you will be able to find out what's wrong

9
00:39.770 --> 00:44.360
in your code and get a deeper understanding of why it went wrong.

10
00:44.360 --> 00:47.640
Also, consider the many hints and things

11
00:47.660 --> 00:50.970
I will teach you in the debugging section of this course.

12
00:51.080 --> 00:56.560
There, I will teach you how to handle React errors and how to react to them and fix them;

13
00:56.750 --> 00:59.470
definitely something you have to know how to do.

14
00:59.540 --> 01:04.460
So use that knowledge you gain there to fix any issues you encounter.

15
01:04.460 --> 01:10.070
Now, if you're stuck and you can't find the error, ask in the Q&A section.

16
01:10.070 --> 01:13.940
My team and I are more than happy to help you. But, this is important,

17
01:13.940 --> 01:15.500
don't just ask but

18
01:15.590 --> 01:17.360
also answer in the Q&A.

19
01:17.360 --> 01:19.970
I'm not saying this because I don't want to answer your questions.

20
01:20.000 --> 01:25.220
I will, but if you answer, you'll learn way more than if you just ask.

21
01:25.220 --> 01:27.740
Asking is super-simple; but answering is hard.

22
01:27.770 --> 01:29.580
You can't go wrong and

23
01:29.810 --> 01:32.850
even if your answer is wrong, no one is going to kill you.

24
01:32.870 --> 01:39.380
Instead, you're going to learn if people correct you and answering forces you to think about a problem

25
01:39.440 --> 01:40.820
and find a solution.

26
01:40.850 --> 01:47.630
If you really want to become a great React developer, you have to solve problems and answering the Q&A

27
01:47.630 --> 01:55.150
section is a good way of practicing just that. Finally, practice, practice, practice;

28
01:55.160 --> 01:56.540
it's as easy as that.

29
01:56.630 --> 02:00.390
Even after you've finished this course, you've got to practice the things you've learned.

30
02:00.530 --> 02:07.850
You have to build your own demo projects, set your own challenges, do the exercises from this course, alter

31
02:07.940 --> 02:11.630
the code you'll learn in this course and practice React.

32
02:11.900 --> 02:17.900
If you follow these steps and follow through this entire course, you'll be an awesome React developer

33
02:18.320 --> 02:20.410
and you'll be able to apply for jobs,

34
02:20.420 --> 02:23.850
become a React freelancer; whatever you want. With that,

35
02:24.020 --> 02:27.520
let's dive into React and learn how it works.
