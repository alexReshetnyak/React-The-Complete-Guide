Welcome to this course about React. It's so great to have you onboard.

1
00:06.810 --> 00:09.920
My name is Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller and I'm a freelance web developer

2
00:09.960 --> 00:16.500
and React developer. I've worked with React a lot and I can tell you it's an amazing library for creating

3
00:16.500 --> 00:24.360
highly-reactive and superfast JavaScript-driven web applications. The JavaScript-driven part is especially

4
00:24.360 --> 00:31.020
important because React is a JavaScript library (it's about writing your web apps in JavaScript).

5
00:31.650 --> 00:38.250
This is amazing because JavaScript runs in the browser and it allows you to create superfast

6
00:38.340 --> 00:40.880
web apps that feel like mobile apps

7
00:41.040 --> 00:44.190
(users don't have to wait for page reloads).

8
00:44.310 --> 00:51.060
Now, React is probably 'the' most popular JavaScript library you can learn these days

9
00:51.060 --> 00:56.940
and for a good reason. You will learn all of its core features throughout this course and way more than that.

10
00:57.480 --> 01:01.960
You will learn what React is about, how it works and why you might want to use it.

11
01:01.980 --> 01:07.620
You will learn how to build components with React, how to use Redux for better state management and how

12
01:07.620 --> 01:13.450
to use the React Router; and you'll not just learn this as simple projects or theory.

13
01:13.610 --> 01:18.230
We will also build an entire React application throughout this course.

14
01:18.270 --> 01:24.360
The 'Burger Builder' is an amazing application utilizing all the concepts you'll learn in this course,

15
01:24.690 --> 01:30.410
so that you have a really solid understanding of all the concepts taught throughout this course.

16
01:30.600 --> 01:36.450
By the end of this course, you'll therefore have way more than just a solid understanding of React;

17
01:36.450 --> 01:43.230
you'll be able to dive deeper into more challenging projects and apply for React developer jobs (or become

18
01:43.230 --> 01:44.370
a React Developer

19
01:44.400 --> 01:47.250
as a freelancer)...whatever your goal is.
