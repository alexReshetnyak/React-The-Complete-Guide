1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,630
So let's use this firebase service.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,470
As I said simply just as kind of a dummy backend because it's easy to get started with it

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,600
and for our needs here, it's free.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:18,480
Check out the pricing page on firebase.google.com/pricing to learn what's included in

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,580
the free plan and when it's going to cost money,

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,080
that's especially important of course if you plan on using this in production environments for your

7
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,670
real application.

8
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,370
No worries though, if you stay in the free plan you actually can't be charged,

9
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:40,080
you'll just be limited once you exceed the free limits which of course you also don't want to encounter

10
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,040
in your production ready application.

11
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,020
Now enough of the talking about the pricing it's free for our needs

12
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,810
so let's click on go to console, for that you'll need a Google account,

13
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:53,530
so that is something you will need to create before you can continue

14
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,710
and on that console, you can now create a new project here.

15
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:04,350
So let's create the project I'm going to name it react my burger, you can choose any name you like

16
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:09,450
and then you choose a country or region here and you can choose the country where you are located.

17
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,980
this won't affect where the data will be stored at the end,

18
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,320
and then click create project.

19
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:21,770
As I said this will now configure up backend projects for you which automatically gives you some REST

20
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:29,430
API endpoints and MongoDB like database which you can use to store data so that we don't have to write

21
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,080
any server side code.

22
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,300
The console is going to look like this,

23
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:34,520
now no worries,

24
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,430
you don't need any deeper firebase understanding here.

25
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:43,490
We're going to use the database because we want to store data and firebase has this syntax where the

26
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,810
API endpoints are directly mapped to endpoints or to tables

27
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,250
you could say, in your database.

28
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:55,620
So it's super easy to get started storing data there.

29
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,910
Now this is the API endpoint

30
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,080
we're going to use so you of course have a different one for your project but this is the endpoint

31
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:09,560
where we can send data to you and then it will automatically be stored in that database.

32
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:12,710
Still we won't be connecting to the database directly,

33
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:19,610
We're just sending HTTP request and firebase is doing the mapping of HTTP endpoints to the database,

34
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:25,260
that's the cool thing about this service. Now for this to be available, there's one thing we need to set

35
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:33,660
up under rules here, on database rules you should set read and write access simply to true.

36
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,910
Now by default it's only enabled for authenticated users

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,790
and this makes sense for production ready application

38
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,770
but we haven't implemented user authentication yet

39
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,070
So we have no authenticated users.

40
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:51,080
So for the moment let's turn this to true so that everyone can read or write,

41
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,950
of course not something you want for your real application which you ship,

42
00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:00,020
at least that's the most likely use case that you don't want to give global

43
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,650
read or write access.

44
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,990
Make sure to publish your updated rules

45
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,120
and with that we're already ready to go,

46
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:06,930
that's all.

47
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,790
We don't have to configure anything else,

48
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:15,750
we can get started and we can start sending HTTP requests to this endpoint or some nested endpoints as

49
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,100
you going to see.

50
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,820
Now with that in the next lecture,

51
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:25,170
let's dive right into that and let's start sending HTTP requests to our backend here.
