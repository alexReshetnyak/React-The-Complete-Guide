1
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:07,330
So in the last lecture we created this firebase project and we had changed the rules,

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:14,730
now let's start sending HTTP requests to this endpoint and to send HTTP requests,

3
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,970
we of course should install a new package in our course project.

4
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:25,830
We do this with npm install --save axios is the package I want to install because you're just

5
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,690
like in the HTTP module,

6
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,890
I want to use axios to set my HTTP requests.

7
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:38,210
You can of course use a different Ajax package but axios is really great and I can only recommend it.

8
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:43,260
Thereafter, we can restart the development server with npm start

9
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,290
and now of course we want to add axios to our application.

10
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:55,020
In the last course module, you saw different ways of adding it, adding it by creating an axios instance

11
00:00:55,290 --> 00:01:00,000
or simply importing it and potentially setting up some defaults.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,700
Now I will add it by adding axios instance but you could also just import it globally and set these global

13
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,940
defaults you saw in the last module,

14
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,900
definitely play around with both,

15
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,110
choose whichever one you like more.

16
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:22,900
Now to create an instance of axios, I'm going to create a new file and I'm going to name these axios

17
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:30,600
orders.js because I'm going to use that for all the order related stuff. And in there, I now need to

18
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:38,010
import axios from the axios package and then call axios create and pass a javascript object to configure

19
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:38,780
it.

20
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:46,050
Now in there, I'll set up the base URL to that path I just copied from firebase. This is your URL

21
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:50,760
where you want to send your request to to store your data in the database.

22
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,260
And again just in case you missed it, it's this path

23
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:02,280
here you can see under database data, that is what I set up as my default base URL here. Of course, this

24
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:08,820
instance which gets created here should be stored in some constants or a constant or variable and naming

25
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,910
it instance here

26
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,520
and then I can export this as the file default.

27
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,100
Now I have my own axios instance configured for this base URL,

28
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:23,670
this is also the reason why I use this instance approach because later in the course when we add authentication,

29
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,230
we'll all use a different URL with axios,

30
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:34,230
so I don't want to set to base URL as a global default even though for the moment I could do that.

31
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,640
So now we get the axios instance created,

32
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,570
that's great.

33
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,440
Let's now actually move on to sending requests there.
