1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:07,510
So welcome back to our course project, our burger builder. Now the burger builder is already pretty

2
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:07,920
great,

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:12,610
we can build burgers with it, which doesn't sound too bad for this kind of application.

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,000
Now we can continue to check out and right

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:19,240
now when we click this, nothing happens except for this alert.

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,430
Now in the last module we learned how we can actually send HTTP requests,

7
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:28,680
so this sounds like a great opportunity to actually store that order

8
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:35,570
the customer's about to place on a server. Now we'll then find through this application later in

9
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:40,840
the course once we know how to create different pages in our single page app and therefore for show a check

10
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,280
out for them and so on.

11
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:50,350
But for now, storing the order and getting the orders that would be an amazing advancement in our application.

12
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:57,340
So this is what this module is about, we'll implement the backend so that we can actually store our orders

13
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,580
so that we have a way of retrieving them

14
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:07,780
even after our page was reloaded. For that storing on the backend, I'm going to use firebase. Firebase is

15
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,760
a service offered by Google

16
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:15,890
it's essentially out of the box working backend which includes a database.

17
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:22,840
The cool thing is we can use it for free and for the amount of usage we're going to apply in this course

18
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:29,410
project, it's going to stay free and we don't have to write any server side code which this course of course

19
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:36,170
is not about. But the way we communicate with firebase is the same we communicate with any other backend,

20
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:40,220
so this is representative for your backend in your project.

21
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:47,080
Now with that let's dive into that and let's create our firebase project in the next lecture so that

22
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:50,150
we then can start storing our orders there.
