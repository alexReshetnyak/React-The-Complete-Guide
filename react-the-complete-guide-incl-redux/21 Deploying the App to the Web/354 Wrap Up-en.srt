1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:05,780
So we deployed our application in this module,

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:10,240
the last and of course very important step to really conclude this project.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,030
We now see a run in the internet and that of course is a huge step.

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:22,030
It is a step towards really building realistic react apps because such apps of course should also be

5
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:23,710
able to run in the internet.

6
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,150
As you saw deployment is super easy,

7
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:27,220
it's one command and

8
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:33,880
a couple of things to keep in mind and no matter which host you then choose, these steps never change.

9
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:39,760
So with that, I hope you enjoyed building this application and I hope you enjoy your delicious burger.
