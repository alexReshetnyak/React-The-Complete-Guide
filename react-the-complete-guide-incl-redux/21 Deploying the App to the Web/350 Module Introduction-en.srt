We're nearing the end of the core react features, we built our amazing react application throughout the

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:12,830
course and we even added a bit of testing to it in the last module.

00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:19,230
Now it's time to deploy this application so that we can really see it run somewhere in the internet.

00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,000
and of course I'll also show you an example in this module.
