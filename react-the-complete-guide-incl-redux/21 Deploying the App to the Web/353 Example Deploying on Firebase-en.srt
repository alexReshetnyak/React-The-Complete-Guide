1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,570
In the last lecture we built our files,

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:10,350
now I want to deploy it and you're really free to choose which ever static file host you want to use.

3
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:16,730
Simply follow the instructions of your chosen host to upload the files in the build folder and make

4
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,040
sure that you always return the index.html

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,910
file. I'll use firebase hosting,

6
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,920
so in the firebase console of the project we already have,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,710
we can click on hosting and there on get started, we get instructions. Now for firebase hosting,

8
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,570
we actually need to install an extra tool globally on our machine,

9
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:42,520
if you don't want this simply follow along with another static host of your choice like AWS S3

10
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,010
.

11
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:48,710
check out the documentations of whichever host you chose to learn how to deploy to that specific

12
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:49,460
page.

13
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:54,330
So here I'm going to copy the command and with sudo on Mac,

14
00:00:54,350 --> 00:01:01,310
on Windows you don't need that and then the copied command, I can install these firebase tools globally

15
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:02,320
on my machine.

16
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:05,090
Now it will take a couple of seconds for this to finish,

17
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:08,920
we can already jump ahead and have a look at the second step.

18
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:09,910
There you see that

19
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,830
once the tools were installed, you can run firebase login to authenticate with your firebase account and

20
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:21,410
then initialize your project to be the firebase project you want to deploy and then deploy with the

21
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:22,650
deploy command,

22
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,250
now we'll do this together.

23
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,410
So let's wait for days to finish,

24
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:31,550
once it did finish, you have to run the firebase login.

25
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:38,110
I already did this I'll continue with firebase init and now you're asked which features you want to use here,

26
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:42,430
now we can just check hosting by pressing space after navigating to that option,

27
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,110
we don't need any of the other,

28
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:47,260
then hit enter.

29
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,940
Now you choose the project you want to use,

30
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,320
so I'll do that here too.

31
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:58,360
Now you asked what your public directory is and for us, that's not the default of public but build,

32
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:05,080
that tells firebase which files to upload and we want to upload all files in the build directory,

33
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,530
So I'll enter build.

34
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,180
Now do we want you configured as a single page app?

35
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,440
yes we do.

36
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,870
This will automatically set this up to always return index.html

37
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,030
as it says here

38
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,730
so enter Y for yes.

39
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,530
Now it asks us if it should overwrite the index.html file it found,

40
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,670
the answer is No

41
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:31,170
so N because we obviously want to keep the one generated by our project and with that we're done. Now

42
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:37,770
in the case of firebase, this gave us a special firebase rc file and a firebase.json file to configure

43
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:43,270
this project. FirebaseRC simply contains information about this project,

44
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,200
obviously you should replace this with your project ID,

45
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:53,230
if you ever download my project and want to use that and firebase.json this is where the hosting is configured,

46
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:58,510
where the public folder is set up to be the build folder, where it ignore some files to not upload

47
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:05,500
these and where it also rewrites all incoming requests to return index.html and for firebase, you

48
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,680
can read more in their documentation, for your favorite static site hosts,

49
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,810
you pick their docs, of course.

50
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:17,140
So for firebase with all that set up, we can deploy this with firebase deploy, for other hosts,

51
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:22,210
you might need to manually upload the files there, that also shouldn't be too difficult though.

52
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:28,060
So with that, it's preparing our build directory for upload as it's saying, it uploaded it and now we can visit

53
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:34,520
the application here under this hosting URL and there also are ways for assigning your own domain,

54
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:39,760
just check out the firebase docs if you're interested. Let's visit this page

55
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:46,700
and now there, we see our application running as it ran on our local machine.

56
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:54,520
So there of course we can now also login, it's using the same database behind the scene and then also

57
00:03:54,520 --> 00:04:00,370
start building our burger here, order that and so on.

58
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:04,600
This is now our application running on a real server.
