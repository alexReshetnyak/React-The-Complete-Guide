1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:05,850
I'm back in the project and now I want to deploy this application.

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,050
So this is the project as we left it,

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,030
I didn't change anything.

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,450
Now the first thing is the base path,

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:13,730
we can see this in the

6
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:14,880
app.js file,

7
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:21,870
excuse me, in the index.js file where we have the browser router, there we could set the basename property

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,830
but I plan on serving my app from mydomain.com/nothing

9
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,110
so I don't need to set this. Now

10
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:34,640
the next thing is that I need to ensure that the server always returns to index.html file,

11
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:40,560
that is something all static hosts typically allow you to configure and if you're not using a static

12
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:46,960
host but you are using your nodejs server, you just need to write code, you need to set up a catch all

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,170
route and return index.html

14
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:52,810
and the same logic of course applies for any other server side language.

15
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:58,550
So for us here, the next step is to build the project and this is run with the npm command,

16
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:09,070
npm run build. This will now build our project, similar to npm start but now it will also spit out a folder

17
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:17,040
and not just store the result in memory and that folder will contain our optimized production build.

18
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:24,010
So there, we get this new build folder now in the project folder and if we have a look at this, we see

19
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:29,910
our single page which also is optimized to consume as little space as possible.

20
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:36,100
You'll see that some script imports were added there, like to this main js file and that is what we

21
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,230
can find in the static folder,

22
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:45,400
there we got our media files, images like the burger logo and the javascript files for our different

23
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,100
chunks for lazy loading and the main js file.

24
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,540
We also got source maps here,

25
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:57,080
now you don't need to deploy these though, these are purely optional,

26
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,880
you can focus on the javascript files but you can also and that is what I'll do deploy

27
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,650
the content of the whole build folder and that's important.

28
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:13,000
The content of the build folder, ship that content, all the files there and the static folder to your static

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,830
host.

30
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,150
So now let's deploy this.

31
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,420
We'll do this in the next lecture.
