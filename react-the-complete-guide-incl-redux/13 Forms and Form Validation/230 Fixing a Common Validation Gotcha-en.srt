1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:09,400
To fix our validation flaw, what we can do is we can set isValid true by default here at the beginning

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,400
and then we can add something to each check

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:18,270
here. We can say isValid should it be true if this check is true

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,010
and if isValid already was true

5
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,400
so we change && isValid. If we do

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,540
this in every rule, then just this rule resolving to true alone won't do the trick,

7
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:33,380
all the rules now have to resolve to true.

8
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:39,140
So if we save it with this change in place and I now start entering into the zip code, one digit it's

9
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,770
false, no digits it's false,

10
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:48,580
now if I enter five digits, it's true because it's not too long not too short

11
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:52,580
and there, if I interest six digits though, it's false.

12
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:58,580
Now if I have a look at the name and I enter something there, you see it's true because I entered something,

13
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:03,560
if I empty it you'll see it's false because now it's empty.

14
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,800
This is now our own validation working,

15
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:10,160
we got our own rules set up in this flexible way,

16
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:16,150
now we can turn our heads towards also outputting some feedback on our validation result.
