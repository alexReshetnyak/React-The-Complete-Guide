1
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:09,620
Now over this module, we did add a lot of forms and validation related functionality and I noticed a

2
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:10,210
bug,

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,990
I'll be honest I noticed it after I recorded this module.

4
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,130
It's not a severe one,

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,610
we're going to fix it later in this course. In our contact data container where we have the state managing

6
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:27,140
our form controls, delivery method, that's our select element right,

7
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:31,430
and there I set a value of empty string initially.

8
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:37,650
Now we have the options, fastest or cheapest, an empty string doesn't make much sense,

9
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,680
now on the UI we will see fastest and cheapest

10
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:47,410
but if we never switch the option, behind the scenes value will always stay an empty string,

11
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:50,670
it will always be updated once we trigger onChange,

12
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:57,230
so once we did change the value once. This will become an issue later when we submit our form to the

13
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:02,940
server, then we will actually submit an empty value in case we never switch the value. Again,

14
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,180
I will fix it later in the course

15
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,650
just in case you already noted it,

16
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:08,580
good job.

17
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:09,910
Again will be fixed,

18
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:17,660
the fix is as easy as simply entering fastest or cheapest as the default here and you can choose which ever

19
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,560
one you want.

20
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,620
So that is how to fix this,

21
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,800
again I'll leave it as we have it here, will be fixed later.
