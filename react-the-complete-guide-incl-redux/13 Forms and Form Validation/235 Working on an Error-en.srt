00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:09,610
In the last lecture we detected this error when we change the value of our dropdown, it is related

2
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:16,720
to our validation check in the contact data container. There in check validity,

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,570
we check if rules required,

4
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:21,820
the problem is rules,

5
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,050
what does this get,

6
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,920
what does rule of this argument refer to?

7
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,780
Let's have a look at where we call check validity,

8
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:34,420
we call it in the inputChangedHandler and we pass the update form element value

9
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:38,410
and for rules, updatedFormElement validation.

10
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:46,400
Now the thing is this validation object doesn't exist for the dropdown for delivery method,

11
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:56,290
so if we then try to access required on something which doesn't exist, we get an error. Two ways of fixing

12
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:56,970
that,

13
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:05,770
the first way is simply add an empty validation object to the dropdown control.

14
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:11,520
Now accessing validation required will not fail but simply return undefined,

15
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:16,340
I like this way a lot because now all our controls are set up equally,

16
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,510
they all have a validation property and a valid property,

17
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:23,170
and if they don't need validation, then it should just be empty.

18
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:25,400
This is why I like this approach.

19
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:32,380
Now the alternative would have been to also add a check in check validity and see if rules,

20
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:38,890
if this is true-ish which it only is if it is defined and if it is not true-ish, so by adding an exclamation

21
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,390
mark, to simply return true then.

22
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:47,430
So always return true for the check validity result if no validation rules are defined.

23
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:54,490
We can of course also implement both for double security but again, I like the approach up here by adding

24
00:01:54,490 --> 00:02:00,250
this empty validation object the most because it makes all the controls configured equally.

25
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:06,840
Now with this added, if I save this, now we can change the dropdown value again without getting errors

26
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:07,600
as you can see.
