1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:07,270
So we need to be able to create select elements in our input component here too,

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:14,320
so let's add the code to handle this. In the input component where we have our case, switch case statement,

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:20,090
let's add a new case for selects the area elements.

4
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:27,420
So case select then the input element of course is select element or select object

5
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:34,330
and here this actually also has a closing tag because in between, we'll need to create our options.

6
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:41,040
Therefore I'll wrap this in normal parentheses so that I can write multi-line jsx code because again

7
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:48,090
between my select statements here or select tags, I want to add the options. The element config,

8
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:54,690
I don't want to pass it to this element here because in my set up, I only expect to get options let's

9
00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:01,410
say, of course there would be attributes you can set on select and you probably would have to find or

10
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:08,870
define a nested config option here to have the normal attributes or you name it attributes, whatever

11
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,580
you want

12
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,090
but here I only expect to get the options as my element config

13
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:18,830
and I don't want to distribute the options as attributes across my select statement here,

14
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,430
instead I want to set up options here.

15
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,760
And by the way, having that value on the select is important to make two way binding work correctly and

16
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,850
so on.

17
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:37,230
So here I'll add my option element then and each option should have two pieces of information basically,

18
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,330
now obviously I want to create it dynamically,

19
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:46,580
I want to create it from this options array I'm passing as part of the element config.

20
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,850
So in the input component,

21
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:57,360
I actually don't want to hardcode it in there, I'll dynamically create it by taking my props element config

22
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,220
property here,

23
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:06,360
then there, this options property we set up and by mapping this into an array of jsx elements.

24
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:14,130
So here I'll have my option, I want to return jsx of course and the jsx will be an

25
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:22,700
option element, like this where I for one have the value of that element,

26
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:36,290
this will be option, whoops, option value referring to this value property in the individual option object

27
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,130
and then we have the display value,

28
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:44,030
so the thing we want to well show to the user. This is of course what should go between the opening and

29
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,570
closing option tag,

30
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,520
so option display value.

31
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,690
Now with that, we should create such a dropdown.

32
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:56,580
Now let's see if this works by saving this and having a look at our form

33
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:01,040
and yes, we can see a dropdown with the two options we set up.

34
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:07,060
We can't change the value for now because we don't have the onChange handler and the key is missing,

35
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:13,220
so that's something we have to add to the option element because we're creating it with the map method.

36
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,970
So let's simply add a key here

37
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,890
and the key can simply be the option value,

38
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,370
it is a unique value after all.

39
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:26,600
So now we get the input element adjusted to also be able to render dropdowns and you could of course

40
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:31,020
come up with more form elements you want to support like check boxes,

41
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:36,770
always think about how you need to configure it and make sure you get that configuration object into

42
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,420
your input component

43
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,210
but I want to go with the setup we use here.

44
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:49,220
Now with that all set up, I now want to take care about us actually receiving the values when the user

45
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,110
enters something.
