Welcome to this course module, our application is taking shape

2
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:12,940
but there is one element in the application we haven't really taken care about and that is our contact

3
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,970
data form in our burger application.

4
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:21,980
In general, we haven't talked too much about forms in this course yet, we talked about handling input

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,150
with two way binding and this often is enough

6
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:31,540
but if you really have a form and you also want to validate that form, that is something that can be

7
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:39,010
complex due to the way react works, due to it being just javascript. In this module,

8
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:45,070
we'll have a look at forms and form validation and how we actually may handle our contact data form in

9
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,470
the burger application with ease.
