1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:07,610
So in the last lecture we defined our javascript object which should represent our form.

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,180
Now I want to output that in my render method here,

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:18,240
I want to create all these inputs dynamically. So I'll get rid of them in the render form here for now

4
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:26,790
and I now need to first of all turn my order form object here into some kind of array

5
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:33,120
I can loop through, an array where we basically have javascript objects where this key is just one property,

6
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:37,790
an identifier property and then we also still have the other properties.

7
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,730
Well we can create such an array relatively simple here,

8
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,860
there are always more than one method, of course here,

9
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:50,790
I'll create my form elements array, a constant which is an empty array and then I will use a for/in loop

10
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,380
where I get to keys of my

11
00:00:53,460 --> 00:01:02,700
now this.state.orderForm and the key therefore are of course the property names of that object.

12
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:09,130
So the keys are going to be name, street, zipcode and so on

13
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:16,460
and if we access order form for a given key, we get these values here on the right side of course.

14
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:25,740
So with that information, let's go down there and let's create or let's push I should say a new object

15
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,480
to the form elements array,

16
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:34,620
this object should have an id which is the key, because again that is name and so on, these are identifiers

17
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:45,720
and then it should have the config which is this.state.orderForm for a given key.

18
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,270
So this is now the right side of this property

19
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:56,110
so this javascript object, that is what we we'll store in this config property. And of course, you can

20
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:59,840
name the config property whatever you want, you can name it set up whatever you want.

21
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:05,010
So now we got an array of javascript objects, with that array we can work

22
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:12,150
I can work with it by now creating my form here while looping through all these elements.

23
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:20,680
So I will add curly braces here in the form and now I want to loop through my form elements array with

24
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,640
the map method of course to generate a new array basically, here

25
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:32,470
this will get the individual form element and it just returns some jsx here, the jsx it returns

26
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:37,440
of course, it should be my custom input component.

27
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:43,210
And now we can configure it, it should have the elements and the element type.

28
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:50,530
Now the element type can be accessed on the form element in my array and there I said that in this config

29
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:54,510
property, we would store the right side of our setup,

30
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,940
so this object.

31
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,600
So in the config property, this is just another javascript object,

32
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,740
there should be the element type property, an element config and value

33
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,360
and these are properties I want to pass on.

34
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:16,390
So in the end what I pass on here is form element, config and then there as I just said, the element type.

35
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:25,340
So just the name we have here, element type, we pass element config and value in the same way,

36
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,540
so here we passed the element type,

37
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:35,080
now the element config is passed as I just said in the same way with form element config, element

38
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:41,030
config and the value also is passed like this element,

39
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:41,780
excuse me,

40
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:47,590
form element, form element config element config.

41
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,670
Let's get rid of that dummy and put elements here at the top

42
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:54,380
and with that we should dynamically create our input elements.

43
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:02,580
Now as always, I forgot my key and right now we're not having an onChange handler,

44
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:08,100
we also right now seem to have issues extracting our placeholder,

45
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,180
it's an object and not a string

46
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,070
so these are things we have to take care about.

47
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,630
Let's start with the key, for the key,

48
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:21,970
I'll simply take form element id property we add in our loop here, have a typo here,

49
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:27,030
now regarding the missing onChange handler for which I also got an error, we'll take care about this in

50
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:27,990
a second.

51
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,430
Let's have a look at why we have issues outputting our placeholder though,

52
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:38,250
I've found the error, I'm passing the wrong value, it's not the placeholder,

53
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,840
the value is wrong. Here of course, this should be config value not element config.

54
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:46,070
Now if that we're outputting the placeholder,

55
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,090
this all is working.

56
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:54,000
Now of course, we also have to make sure if we can react to changes and that we also have a way of handling

57
00:04:54,030 --> 00:05:01,680
our dropdown down because right now, this is created incorrectly because of course here we have our switch

58
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,780
statement and the input component, we handle inputs and text areas but we also try to create a select element,

59
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,640
we do this here in our set up for delivery method, should be select with options.

60
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:17,760
So let's add or let's adjust our input component to also be able to create that before we then have a

61
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,360
look at how we can actually get the data

62
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,360
the user enters.
