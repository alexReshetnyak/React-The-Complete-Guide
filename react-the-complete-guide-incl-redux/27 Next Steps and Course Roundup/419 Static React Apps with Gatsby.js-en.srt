1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:06,900
So you had a look at build with react and react.rocks,

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:10,550
now let's move away from demo projects and so on

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:14,500
and let's instead have a look at gatsbyjs.

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:22,160
Now gatsbyjs is actually a library building up on react, just like nextjs did, gatsbyjs serves a

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,550
different purpose though and it's a pretty exciting library

6
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:33,440
I'll be honest with you. Gatsbyjs is a library that allows you to build static web sites with react.

7
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:40,210
Now what's a static website? A static website is a page which uses only html, javascript and css,

8
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:46,550
well that's true for normal, react single page application too but a static site also has one special

9
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:47,930
thing going for it,

10
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:53,220
you normally don't use react router there, you don't use it directly at least,

11
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:59,960
instead what you have is you have a folder structure where each folder has an index.html file, and the according

12
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:02,780
assets belonging to the file in it.

13
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:09,320
Now the cool thing with that is that you really build websites like you did in the 90s or around that

14
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:17,180
time but you're using react, you're building this as a react app and gatsbyjs, this technology, this

15
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,780
library then actually does the rest for you,

16
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:25,700
splits everything up and upon a certain command, generates this folder structure where you got a couple

17
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:30,520
of folders with html files in there based on the react that you built.

18
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,510
You can learn more about it on gatsbyjs.com,

19
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:39,830
it's an amazing library and it actually would provide enough content for its own course.

20
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:42,140
Now I don't have such a course right now,

21
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:46,880
you could start with the docs here though to learn how to use it and definitely play around with

22
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:53,630
it a bit to learn more about how it works and if it makes sense for you, comparable alternatives mentioned

23
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,930
on the features page of gatsbyjs would be Jekyll

24
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,940
but there you don't use react or content management systems like Wordpress,

25
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,810
there however, you are stuck to writing some server side code too,

26
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:11,780
you need a SQL database and all that stuff. Gatsbyjs works with react and that offers quite a lot

27
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,280
of advantages.

28
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,730
So consider this for your next project,

29
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:20,610
check out the docs and the features page on their page to learn if it's the right choice for you

30
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,610
and once you decide that it's interesting to you, feel free to dive into it.

31
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:29,370
I wanted to make you aware of it because it's a really amazing project.
