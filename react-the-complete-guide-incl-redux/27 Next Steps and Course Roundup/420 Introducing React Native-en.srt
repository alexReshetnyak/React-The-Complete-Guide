00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,960
In the last lecture, I introduced you to Gatsbyjs

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,310
and I called it an amazing project,

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:08,540
it is.

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,010
If that was amazing,

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,980
react native was just mind blowing.

6
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,830
React native, if you google for it you'll find the official page on

7
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:22,570
github is another project created by Facebook. React native essentially is react

8
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,860
but for mobile apps

9
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:33,140
and with that, I mean native apps, native iOS s or Android apps. With reactjs taught in this course,

10
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,980
you of course learned how to build web apps with javascript,

11
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:37,900
with react native,

12
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:46,970
you use javascript and react and another library, react native to build mobile apps. You still write

13
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,510
javascript code

14
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:55,170
but then react native will compile that to code that runs on iOS or Android devices,

15
00:00:55,310 --> 00:01:01,460
it does so by exposing some building blocks to you like this view component which is your alternative

16
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,430
to a div.

17
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,020
Divs only work in web browsers of course,

18
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:11,390
now the view behind the scenes is an element, an element running on iOS or Android.

19
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,560
That's the idea behind react native,

20
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:20,250
you write native code but with javascript that gets compiled and with the same react logic you learned

21
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,250
in this code.

22
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:26,990
So you still need to learn some new things when diving into react native because of all these new components

23
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:31,880
and some other things that change but it's still extremely simple to get started.

24
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,910
There even is a create react app alternative for react native,

25
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:41,690
it's called create react native app, so very close to the name I guess.

26
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:47,480
Definitely feel free to dive into react native, dive into docs, use that create react native app too

27
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:54,080
and feel free to take your react knowledge to start building native apps with it,

28
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:59,780
it takes some adjustments, it takes some new things to learn but it's an amazing opportunity to build

29
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:03,430
real native apps and not just web apps.

30
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,340
Now that's not necessarily better

31
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,630
but if you want to get into native app development, with that you've got a chance of doing so without

32
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:15,160
learning Android or Swift Objective-C first.
