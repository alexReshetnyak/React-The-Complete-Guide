Welcome to this module, you made it through the course, you learned a lot about react and you're probably

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,380
wondering what are the next steps.

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:14,680
Well obviously, next steps are what I mentioned right at the start of the course,

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,850
practice, practice, practice.

5
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:22,010
You learned a lot about react and react as you learned has a lot of different concepts and things you

6
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,150
can do with it.

7
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,920
Now this course covered them, you now need to practice that,

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,040
so definitely dive back into some of the sections of this course,

9
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:37,130
pick the things which you might have already forgotten by now and practice them in projects you set

10
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:44,840
on your own. Set your own challenges, come up with demo projects you want to build, with popular apps you

11
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,430
want to clone and then just do it and practice the things you learned,

12
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,060
you'll hit some walls but I'm sure you can do it.

13
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,290
Besides practicing, what else can you do,

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,770
what makes sense?

15
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,540
Let's take a closer look over the next lectures.
