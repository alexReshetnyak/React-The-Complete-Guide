00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:07,510
In the last lecture we had a look at react native, an amazing library and I can only recommend you

2
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:08,910
to dive into it.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,750
Now let's move back to reactjs

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:17,410
though and let's have a look at Material-UI. Material-UI is another library

5
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,440
you can use together with react

6
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:25,050
but unlike nextjs or Gatsbyjs, it's not building up on react,

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,620
it's a component library instead and it's not the only one.

8
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:33,180
There are a lot of component libraries you can import into your react project

9
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:40,490
and as the name suggests, component libraries are libraries that give you pre-built and pre-styled

10
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,940
components. You can still write your own ones

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,070
but for example Material-UI gives you beautiful nice working material design components.

12
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:53,790
If you go on their website, make sure to click on that yeah

13
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,650
version one is coming link if it's still showing up for you at the top of the page.

14
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:04,510
There on their web page, you can click on component demos and actually see the many components you

15
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:08,410
can easily import and use in your projects,

16
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:11,270
you can always find the source code for a given demo

17
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:17,140
if you click on that source code icon here on the top right corner of the example and then you see what

18
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,650
you need to import from that library,

19
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,480
granted that you have it installed,

20
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,990
you'll learn how to install it on the Getting Started link and then you can quickly add nicely styled and

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,050
looking components without having to build them on your own.

22
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:35,800
That's a powerful feature if you are building very big applications where you want to have a uniform

23
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:41,040
look, you can of course sketch out and build all the core components on your own

24
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:46,690
but if you know that you want to follow the material look, definitely have a look at Material-UI.

25
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,030
.

26
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,800
And if you want another look,

27
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:55,760
have a look at other popular component libraries, like for example bootstrap react.

28
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:01,690
If you search for bootstrap react, you should find that react bootstrap library here where you can

29
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:08,770
also find components that take the bootstrap styling but work nicely in react and are easily integrated

30
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,560
into react apps.

31
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,360
So that's the general thing I want to bring to you with this lecture,

32
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,390
dive into component libraries,

33
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:20,760
be aware that they exist and consider them for your next projects

34
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,580
if you need uniform styling,

35
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:28,720
don't want to build all these components on your own and just want to have nice react components as

36
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,160
you would have build them on your own

37
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:34,700
but just ready to be dropped in into your own react application.
