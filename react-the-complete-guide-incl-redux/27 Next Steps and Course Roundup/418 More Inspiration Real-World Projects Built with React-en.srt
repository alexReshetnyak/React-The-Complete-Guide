00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:05,170
In the last video we had a look at reactrocks.com,

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,780
now I want to guide you to this Google search, build with react.

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:16,560
Now this might sound stupid but if you look at it, you will for one find an official link so on the official

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,850
react repo where you can find projects that are using react and you can look through that list.

5
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:28,710
Now if you click on one of these projects, you'll be redirected to the page not to the source code.

6
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:35,160
Still, when I talked about practicing that, this can give you some ideas about what you can build because

7
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,440
since all of that here is built with react,

8
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:42,260
well you certainly can't find an excuse that you can't do it with react.

9
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,700
So definitely feel free to play around here and dig into these projects to get an idea about what you

10
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,540
might build.

11
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:54,380
You will also find more sites when searching for build with react, like madewithreact.com,

12
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:00,080
you can also check this out and then find some projects there which you can inspect and there you should

13
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,050
also find the source code for the project.

14
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:09,690
So that again is another way of really practicing react and digging into other people's projects to

15
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,790
learn how you may improve your code,

16
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,300
however people solved certain problems and so on.

17
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:21,940
So build with react, another great resource to learn more about react and find out how it works.
