1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:08,370
So over the last lectures we had a look at a lot of possible next steps including libraries like Gatsbyjs

2
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,700
or component libraries like Material-UI.

3
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,330
Here's one other nice library you might want to look into,

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:24,630
preact. Now that's no typo, preact which you can read more about on preactjs.com is a lightweight

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,340
alternative to react,

6
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:34,060
it's only 3kb big and it offers pretty much the same with some deviations but not that many

7
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:37,820
API react does. So should you always use that,

8
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,580
are the creators of react stupid?

9
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,580
They are not,

10
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:47,910
there are differences and I will talk about these in the next lecture but for now, let me explain what

11
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,170
preact is,

12
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,610
you could always read through this page of course but let's click on the repl here, on that page.

13
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,250
There you simply see an example for the preact or for preact in action

14
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,080
and if you analyzed this example, you'll recognize the code.

15
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:10,530
For example down there, we have a normal component in the functional form just using destructuring here

16
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,160
to pull out one property of the props argument

17
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,110
but in the end that's just your normal jsx code,

18
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:23,310
that's just a functional component which gets used. And above and we got a class based one which also extends

19
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,120
component,

20
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:32,970
so this syntax looks a lot like react syntax and it is to a majority or to a certain degree, to a very

21
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:40,860
big degree actually. Preact uses pretty much the same API but uses a leaner diffing algorithm behind

22
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:41,530
the scenes,

23
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:47,010
so for finding out if it needs to update the real dom, it has a leaner algorithm for that.

24
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:53,850
Lean doesn't strictly mean better but of course it leads to a much smaller file size, 3kb

25
00:01:53,970 --> 00:02:00,090
as I just showed you. The important thing here is that preact and you can always learn more here on

26
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:00,930
the guide

27
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:06,670
also offers some differences to react, even some new features as it will turn out

28
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,840
but more about the differences in the next lecture.

29
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:18,270
You can start working with preact, if you google for preact-cli, then you should find this github page where

30
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:25,230
you find a project which is a lot like create react app which allows you to create new preact apps

31
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,180
which use preact instead of react

32
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:33,420
obviously, based on some of the templates you find here. So you can quickly scaffold out a new app where

33
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:39,300
you can use the majority of the things you learned in this course, again differences are highlighted

34
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:47,400
in the next lecture and simply use this much smaller bundle, this much smaller library.

35
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:54,720
This is preact-cli and this is preact, a lightweight alternative using pretty much the same API and

36
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,890
therefore, the things you learned in this course are valid.

37
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:04,470
Now let's find out what the differences are then and when you should and should not use react,

38
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,300
let's do this in the next lecture.
