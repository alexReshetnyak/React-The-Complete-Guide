1
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:08,870
Great job, you made it through this course and therefore you'll learn a lot about react and the whole

2
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:10,970
react ecosystem.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,990
You now definitely have all the core fundamentals and way more than that it takes to become a successful

4
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:19,520
react developer.

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,740
I can of course only wish you all the best for your future

6
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,650
and I definitely want to encourage you here to do one important thing,

7
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:35,210
practice, practice, practice. You practice a lot throughout this course but to really excel at something, you have

8
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:36,570
to keep that going

9
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:42,590
and I can only encourage you to set your own goals, your own challenges. Build web apps with react, set

10
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:47,190
your own demo app you want to build and then build it with react.

11
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:52,370
This is how you'll learn the most about it and how you really become better and better using it and

12
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,610
how you can build your successful react future.

13
00:00:55,610 --> 00:01:00,210
I wish you all the best for that and definitely share anything you build with react,

14
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:01,770
I can't wait to see it

15
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,260
and I really mean it like that.

16
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,690
So all the best to you, would of course be great to welcome you again in any of my other courses or any

17
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:12,890
future course and I can only encourage you to keep on going,

18
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:13,430
bye.
