00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,190
Here's my first advice for you, react.rocks,

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,740
this is a web page

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,820
that hosts a lot of react projects.

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:18,600
You can also search for certain things there, for keywords like redux for example and then you'll find

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,370
some react projects you can check out.

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,520
These are all open source,

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:29,880
you can click on them like on this Netflix movie landing page clone and then you'll find a demo link

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,170
where you should be able to preview the project

9
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:36,550
though some of the projects are down but you should always find a code link,

10
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:42,930
most of the time leading to github, there you can check out this project and that's the cool thing.

11
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:49,800
You can check out these projects and dive into the code written by other react developers.

12
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:56,160
Now one important thing, that code doesn't have to be 100% correct or best practice but it should

13
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:03,270
give you some ideas about how you may optimize your code or how you can solve certain problems

14
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,870
or you simply take one of these projects,

15
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:11,880
don't look into the code and instead, try to build it on your own and then you compare your solution

16
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,610
to the solution of the original offer.

17
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,210
So definitely dig around on reactrocks.com,

18
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,590
it's a great resource to find some nice projects to learn more about react.
