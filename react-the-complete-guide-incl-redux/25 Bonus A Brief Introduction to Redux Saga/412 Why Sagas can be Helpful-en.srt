1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:09,840
So over the last lectures, we moved all the asynchronous code and I can remove the axios import from

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,100
the order action creator file.

3
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:18,300
So we moved all the asynchronous code and even the synchronous side effect code from our action creator

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,270
files to our sagas.

5
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,900
The advantage in quotation marks because it's not necessarily better,

6
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,700
it depends on what you prefer.

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,990
So the advantage can be that our action creators are all very lean,

8
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,030
they really do just one thing,

9
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,600
they create an action

10
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:45,750
they don't run any other code and all our side effect code, so the code that is not related to reduces

11
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,250
or to actions is in our sagas.

12
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:55,500
This is where we have our API calls, our local storage calls where we even might change the route

13
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,470
we're currently on.

14
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:03,240
This is a pattern you don't have to use but it leads to leaner action creators.

15
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:10,650
Now there are a couple of other things I want to show you with redux saga which you also should be aware of

16
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,430
and which should allow you to build really powerful applications.
